For centuries, humans have consumed raw meat as part of their diet, and while modern culinary practices emphasize cooking for flavor and safety, many people, particularly in carnivore and ancestral diets, are revisiting the idea of eating raw meat. The idea of consuming raw meat may seem unconventional to some, but for those on a carnivore diet or those curious about nutrient-dense, primal eating, it raises an important question: **What meats are considered safe to eat raw?**

In this article, we'll dive into the types of meats that are generally safe to consume raw, the precautions you should take, and the health benefits that some believe raw meat can offer.

### **1. Beef: The Go-To for Raw Meat**
When people think of eating raw meat, beef is often the first that comes to mind. It’s no coincidence—beef is one of the safest meats to consume raw, and it's commonly eaten in dishes like steak tartare and carpaccio.

#### **Cuts of Beef Best Eaten Raw:**
- **Steak Tartare**: This dish is typically made from finely chopped or ground lean beef, often seasoned with egg yolk, onions, capers, and spices.
- **Carpaccio**: Thin slices of raw beef served with a light dressing, such as olive oil or lemon juice.
- **Raw Ground Beef**: Popular in some cultures (e.g., "Mett" in Germany), raw ground beef can be eaten, but it's crucial to ensure the meat comes from a trusted source and is fresh.

**Why It's Safe**: Beef has a relatively low risk of contamination when compared to other meats because it comes from a single animal and its cuts are naturally resistant to bacteria when the exterior is seared. However, ground beef is more prone to contamination because it’s made from various parts of the animal, so it's essential to choose high-quality sources.

### **2. Fish: Sashimi and Beyond**
Fish is widely recognized as a safe and popular option for raw consumption. Cultures around the world have embraced raw fish, from Japanese sashimi to Peruvian ceviche.

#### **Types of Fish Often Eaten Raw:**
- **Salmon**: A favorite for sashimi and sushi.
- **Tuna**: Another popular fish served raw in many forms, including sushi and poke bowls.
- **Yellowtail**: Frequently used in sashimi and sushi.
- **Mackerel**: Often eaten raw in Japanese and Mediterranean dishes.
- **Ceviche**: While not entirely raw, fish in ceviche is "cooked" using the acidity of citrus juice.

**Why It's Safe**: Fish, when sourced from high-quality providers and handled properly, is generally safe to consume raw. Sushi-grade fish is specially handled to reduce the risk of parasites and bacterial contamination. If you're interested in eating raw fish at home, ensure it is sushi-grade, fresh, and stored at the right temperature.

### **3. Lamb: Less Common, But Still Safe**
Lamb, particularly in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cultures, is sometimes consumed raw. Dishes like Lebanese **kibbeh nayeh**—a combination of raw minced lamb, bulgur wheat, and spices—are popular in some regions.

#### **Cuts of Lamb Best Eaten Raw:**
- **Lamb Tartare**: Like beef tartare, lamb can be finely chopped and seasoned for a flavorful raw dish.
- **Kibbeh Nayeh**: Minced raw lamb mixed with bulgur and spices, often served as an appetizer.

**Why It’s Safe**: Lamb is less commonly consumed raw compared to beef or fish, but high-quality lamb cuts from trusted sources can be safe. Like beef, it's essential to use fresh meat from grass-fed, pasture-raised sources to minimize the risk of contamination.

### **4. Game Meat: A Wild Option**
Some wild game meats, like venison, are eaten raw in various dishes around the world. However, game meat requires extra care due to the potential presence of parasites.

#### **Types of Game Meat Eaten Raw:**
- **Venison (Deer)**: In some cultures, thinly sliced venison carpaccio is served raw.
- **Elk and Bison**: These are sometimes consumed raw in tartare or carpaccio form.

**Why It’s Safe**: Game meat, particularly venison, can be safe to eat raw if sourced from trusted providers. However, wild game is more prone to carrying parasites, so it’s important to freeze the meat properly before consumption to reduce this risk. The USDA recommends freezing wild game at -4°F (-20°C) for at least 30 days before consuming it raw to kill any parasites.

### **5. Organ Meats: A Nutrient-Dense Raw Option**
Organ meats, also known as offal, are some of the most nutrient-dense parts of an animal and are consumed raw in some traditional diets. Raw liver, in particular, has gained popularity among those following the carnivore diet for its vitamin and mineral content.

#### **Organs Commonly Eaten Raw:**
- **Liver (Beef, Lamb, Chicken)**: Liver is rich in vitamins A, B12, and other nutrients, making it a popular raw superfood for those on ancestral diets.
- **Kidneys**: Some cultures eat kidneys raw, though it is less common than liver.
- **Heart**: Beef heart, in particular, can be consumed raw, often thinly sliced.

**Why It’s Safe**: Organ meats are safe to consume raw if sourced from healthy, grass-fed, pasture-raised animals. They are rich in essential nutrients, and eating them raw preserves their vitamin content. However, organ meats can be more susceptible to bacteria, so careful handling and sourcing are crucial.

### **6. Pork: Handle With Caution**
Pork is not traditionally consumed raw due to its association with parasites like Trichinella. However, some dishes, such as **"mett"** in Germany (raw minced pork), are enjoyed raw in certain regions. Eating raw pork comes with higher risks, so it’s important to freeze pork properly before consumption if you choose to eat it raw.

**Why It’s Risky**: Historically, pork has been associated with parasites and bacteria, making it one of the least safe meats to consume raw. If you do eat raw pork, ensure it has been frozen at -4°F (-20°C) for at least 30 days to kill any parasites.

### **Precautions When Eating Raw Meat**
While eating raw meat has its benefits, it also comes with risks. Here are some tips to reduce those risks:

1. **Source Meat from Trusted Providers**: Always buy high-quality, grass-fed, pasture-raised meats from trusted butchers or suppliers, especially if you plan to eat it raw.
2. **Practice Proper Storage**: Store raw meat at cold temperatures to prevent bacterial growth. Keep raw meat refrigerated and consume it promptly.
3. **Freeze Meat Before Eating**: Freezing meat before consuming it raw can help reduce the risk of parasites. This is especially important for wild game and pork.
4. **Avoid Cross-Contamination**: Handle raw meat carefully to avoid cross-contamination with other foods or surfaces. Use separate cutting boards and knives for raw and cooked meats.

### **Final Thoughts**
Eating raw meat can be safe and nutrient-dense when approached carefully. Beef, fish, lamb, and certain game meats are popular choices for raw consumption, while organ meats like liver are prized for their vitamin content. However, proper sourcing, handling, and freezing are critical to reducing the risk of contamination and parasites. If you’re looking to add raw meat to your diet, follow these guidelines to enjoy the benefits while staying safe.
