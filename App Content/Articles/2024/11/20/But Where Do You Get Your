"But Where Do You Get Your ___?!"

**Summary:**
Worried about nutrient gaps on a carnivore diet? Let's bust the myths and show you how meat has everything you need to thrive!

## The #1 Question Every Carnivore Hears

You know the scene. Youâ€™re at a family gathering on a fine day, happily enjoying a delicious steak, when a well-meaning relative looks at your plate with deep concern and asks the inevitable question:

_"But where do you get your Vitamin C? Youâ€™ll get scurvy!"_

Or maybe itâ€™s about fiber. Or phytonutrients. Or some other random compound found only in kale. ðŸ¤”

Welcome to one of the most common challenges a carnivore faces: navigating the fear of nutrient deficiencies. Let's put on our myth-busting hats and get to the meat of the matter.

### Myth #1: The Vitamin C Scare

This is the big one. We've all seen old movies with pirates losing their teeth to scurvy. But here's the secret: **your body's need for Vitamin C plummets on a carnivore diet.**

Why? Because glucose (from carbs) and Vitamin C use the same transport system to get into your cells. When your diet is full of sugar, Vitamin C has to fight for a spot. It's like trying to get on the last train home on a holiday weekendâ€”total chaos!

When you remove carbs, there's no competition. Your body becomes incredibly efficient at using the Vitamin C it gets. Fresh meat contains small but sufficient amounts of this vitamin, and since you absorb and use it so well, it's more than enough to keep you healthy. No pirates here!

### Myth #2: The Fiber Fallacy

"You need fiber for, you know... *regularity*."

We've been told this our whole lives. But fiber is essentially indigestible plant matter. Its main job is to add "bulk" to your waste to help push it through your system.

On a carnivore diet, you're eating the most bioavailable food on the planet. There is very little waste because your body absorbs and uses almost everything! Think of it this way: if you're producing less trash, you don't need a giant garbage truck to haul it away.

Many people find their digestion becomes better than everâ€”less bloating, less gas, and effortless bathroom trips.

## The Real Secret: Bioavailability is King ðŸ‘‘

Hereâ€™s the most important concept: **It's not what you eat, it's what you *absorb*.**

Plants are full of "anti-nutrients" (like oxalates and phytates) that act like tiny bodyguards, binding to minerals and preventing your body from absorbing them. You might eat a cup of spinach that's technically high in iron, but you'll only absorb a tiny fraction of it.

Animal foods are the opposite. They provide vitamins and minerals in the exact form your body recognizes and needs, with no anti-nutrients blocking the way. The heme iron in a steak is vastly more bioavailable than the non-heme iron in beans.

## How to Eat for Nutrient Super-Abundance

Worries officially busted. Now, how do you make sure you're getting the absolute most out of your carnivore diet?

* **Go Nose-to-Tail:** Don't just eat muscle meat. Beef liver is nature's multivitamin, packed with Vitamin A, B12, folate, copper, and more. Heart is loaded with CoQ10.
* **Fat is Your Friend:** Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat-soluble, meaning they need fat to be absorbed. So, enjoy those fatty ribeyes and butter!
* **Seafood is a Superstar:** Fatty fish like salmon provides a huge dose of Omega-3s and Vitamin D. Shellfish like oysters are zinc-bombs.

So, the next time someone asks where you get your nutrients, you can smile and confidently say, "From the most nutrient-dense, bioavailable food source on earth." Now, pass the steak. ðŸ’ª
