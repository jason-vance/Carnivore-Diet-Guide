## The 5 PM Panic is Real

It's late afternoon. You've had a long day, you're getting hungry, and the thought of figuring out what to cook feels like a monumental task. This is the danger zone‚Äîthe moment when the temptation to grab some less-than-ideal takeout is at its peak.

But what if you had a secret weapon? What if a delicious, satisfying, perfectly carnivore meal was less than five minutes away from being on your plate?

That, my friend, is the superpower of meal planning. And the good news? For carnivores, it's the easiest "meal prep" on the planet. No chopping a million veggies or assembling sad little salads in jars required!

### Why Bother Planning?

Planning your meals isn't about creating a rigid, boring schedule. It's about setting your future self up for a massive win.

* **Defeat Decision Fatigue:** When you're hungry, the last thing you want is another decision. A plan means you can just grab, reheat, and eat.
* **Save Money & Time:** Buying meat in bulk is a carnivore's best friend. A simple plan allows you to take advantage of sales on ground beef or roasts, saving you cash and extra trips to the store.
* **Stay Unstoppable:** Having carnivore food ready to go is your #1 defense against temptation. The easiest meal will always be the one that's already cooked and waiting for you.

## The "Lazy Genius" Carnivore Meal Prep

Forget spending your entire Sunday in the kitchen. This is about maximum results for minimum effort.

#### Step 1: The Big Batch Hero ü¶∏
Pick ONE big cut of meat and cook it all at once. This is the anchor for your week.
* **Ground Beef Gold:** Brown 3-5 pounds of ground beef in a big pot or skillet. Salt it well. Store it in a large container in the fridge. Now you have instant meal bowls for days.
* **The Mighty Roast:** Grab a big chuck roast, pork butt, or brisket. Throw it in the slow cooker or a Dutch oven and cook it low and slow until it's falling apart. Shred it and you're set.
* **The Bacon Strategy:** Cook an entire pack (or two!) of bacon on sheet pans in the oven at 400¬∞F (200¬∞C) until crispy. Store in the fridge for lightning-fast snacks or to add to any meal.

#### Step 2: The Quick-Fire Crew üî•
Stock your fridge and freezer with proteins that cook in under 15 minutes.
* **Steaks:** Ribeyes, sirloins, New York strips‚Äîyour call!
* **Burger Patties:** Have them pre-made and ready to hit the pan.
* **Eggs:** The ultimate carnivore fast food.
* **Canned Fish:** Sardines, salmon, or tuna for a no-cook protein punch.

### Putting It All Together

Your "plan" is now a flexible system. You're not locked into "steak on Monday." You just have options.

* **In a Rush?** Grab a scoop of your pre-cooked ground beef or shredded roast.
* **Have 10 Minutes?** Fry up a couple of eggs and crumble some of that pre-cooked bacon on top.
* **Want a Feast?** Sear a beautiful steak fresh in a cast-iron skillet.

By investing just an hour or two at the start of the week, you've made staying on track the easiest, most delicious choice. Now go forth and conquer your week! üèÜü•©
