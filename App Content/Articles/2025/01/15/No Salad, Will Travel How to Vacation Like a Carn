### Your New Travel Superpower: Simplicity

While other travelers are deciphering complex menus full of weird ingredients, you have the gift of simplicity. You can walk into almost any real restaurant in the world and find your food.

* **Steakhouse?** You're home.
* **Seafood Shack on the beach?** Paradise found.
* **Brazilian Churrascaria?** You've hit the jackpot!

Your order is the simplest and most powerful one you can make: "What is your best cut of meat? Just that, please, cooked with salt." You get to skip all the sugary sauces, weird vegetable oils, and starchy side dishes and go straight for the good stuff.

### Become a Local Meat Explorer üó∫Ô∏èü•©

This is where the real fun begins. Use your carnivore diet as an excuse to dive deep into the local culture.

* **Headed to the Coast? (Maine, Florida, Greece):** You're on a seafood safari! Forget the postcards and find the place with the freshest oysters. Ask what the local fishermen brought in that morning. Grilled fish, shrimp, scallops, and lobster are your new best friends. ü¶ê
* **Going to Cattle Country? (Texas, Argentina, The Midwest):** Welcome to the Carnivore Super Bowl! This is your chance to explore different cuts of steak and find the best local barbecue joint. (Just ask for your brisket "naked" or "dry" to avoid sugary sauces).
* **European Adventure? (Italy, France, Spain):** You're on a mission for the best charcuterie. Think Prosciutto di Parma and salami in Italy, or Jam√≥n Ib√©rico in Spain. Find a classic French bistro and order the *steak au poivre* (ask for it without the sauce, just the steak!).
* **Tropical Getaway? (Hawaii, Caribbean):** Fresh-caught mahi-mahi on the grill, roasted pork (*kalua pig*), and all the seafood you can handle.

### Pro Tips for the Traveling Carnivore

1.  **Do Your Homework:** Before you go, use Google Maps to search for "steakhouse," "seafood," or "barbecue" near your hotel. A little recon goes a long way.
2.  **The Grocery Store is Your Friend:** Your first stop after you land should be a local grocery store. Stock your hotel mini-fridge with bacon, hard-boiled eggs, cheese, or a rotisserie chicken. Breakfast is now sorted!
3.  **Pack Your Snacks:** Bring jerky, biltong, or meat sticks for the plane and for any "food emergencies."
4.  **Communicate with a Smile:** When ordering, be kind and clear. "I have some food allergies, could I please get the grilled fish with nothing on it but salt and butter?" works wonders.

Your carnivore lifestyle doesn't chain you to your kitchen. It frees you to find the highest quality food wherever your adventures take you. So book that trip, pack your bags, and get ready to feast.
