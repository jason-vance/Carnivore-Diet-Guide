## Your Body's Energy Ignition System

It's the afternoon, and maybe you're hitting that little energy slump. Let's talk about one of the secret ingredients to incredible, stable energy: **Thiamine**, also known as Vitamin B1.

If your body is a high-performance engine and the delicious meat you eat is the fuel, then thiamine is the **spark plug**. It‚Äôs the essential vitamin that ignites that fuel, turning protein and fat into pure, usable energy (ATP) to power your every move. Without this crucial spark, you'd just be a car full of gas with no way to get going!

## What Does Thiamine Do, Exactly?

Thiamine is a busy bee in your body, playing a lead role in some seriously important functions.

* **The Energy MVP:** Its main job is converting the food you eat into energy for your cells. Every single cell in your body, from your brain to your biceps, needs it to function.
* **Brain & Nerve Guardian üß†:** Thiamine is critical for maintaining the health of your nervous system. It helps protect the protective sheath around your nerves (the myelin sheath) and is involved in creating neurotransmitters, ensuring your brain-to-body communication is crystal clear.
* **Heart Health Hero:** Your heart is a massive, energy-hungry muscle that never takes a break. It requires a huge and constant supply of thiamine to keep beating strong.

## The Carnivore Advantage: Ditching the Grains

We've all seen cereal boxes fortified with B vitamins, leading to the myth that you need grains to get them. Let's bust that myth right now.

While grains do contain thiamine, they also come packaged with **anti-nutrients** that can interfere with its absorption. The thiamine in meat, on the other hand, is highly bioavailable, with nothing getting in the way.

Even better, the body's demand for thiamine is directly tied to how many carbohydrates you eat. The more carbs you burn, the more thiamine you need. Since a carnivore diet is virtually carb-free, your body becomes incredibly efficient, and your thiamine needs are naturally lower and easily met.



### Top Carnivore Sources for Thiamine

Ready to fire on all cylinders? Here are the best places to get your spark plugs:
* **Pork üêñ:** Pork is the undisputed king of thiamine! A good pork chop or some quality bacon is an amazing source.
* **Salmon:** Fatty fish is another excellent choice.
* **Beef:** Especially nutrient-dense cuts like beef liver.
* **Eggs:** The perfect little package of carnivore goodness.
