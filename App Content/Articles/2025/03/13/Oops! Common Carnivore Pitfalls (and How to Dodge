### Pitfall #1: Not Enough Fat (The "Lean Meat Trap")

This is probably the #1 mistake. We've been told for decades that fat is bad, so many beginners naturally gravitate towards lean cuts of meat (think chicken breast or lean sirloin). The result? They feel tired, hungry, and miserable.

* **The Fix:** Embrace the fat! Fat is your primary fuel source on a carnivore diet. If you're not eating enough, your body will let you know. Opt for fatty cuts like ribeyes, chuck roasts, pork belly, and liberally add butter or tallow to your meals. If you're eating lean meat, add a side of butter or a dollop of sour cream (if you tolerate dairy). Aim for a ratio where your hunger is satisfied and your energy is stable.

### Pitfall #2: Fearing Salt (The "Low Sodium Scare")

We talked about this in a previous article! For years, salt has been demonized. But on a carnivore diet, especially in the beginning, your body flushes out more sodium.

* **The Fix:** Salt your food generously! Listen to your body. If you feel dizzy, fatigued, or get muscle cramps, chances are you need more salt and electrolytes. Use good quality salt like Redmond Real Salt or Celtic Sea Salt.

### Pitfall #3: Snacking Constantly (The "Still Thinking Like a Grazer" Trap)

When you first start, you might still have the habit of reaching for snacks. Your body is used to getting quick sugar fixes.

* **The Fix:** Focus on eating until you are *full and satisfied* at your meals. Healthy animal fats and protein are incredibly satiating. If you're still hungry between meals, your previous meal probably wasn't big enough or fatty enough. Soon, you'll naturally fall into a rhythm of 2-3 solid meals a day without needing snacks.

### Pitfall #4: Not Drinking Enough Water (The "Dehydration Danger")

As your body sheds excess water when you ditch carbs, it's crucial to stay properly hydrated.

* **The Fix:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day. And remember Pitfall #2: add salt to some of your water or generously to your food to ensure proper electrolyte balance.

### Pitfall #5: Comparing Your Journey to Everyone Else's (The "Social Media Trap")

You'll see people online posting about miraculous transformations in three days. While that's awesome for them, everyone's body is different. Some people adapt faster than others.

* **The Fix:** Focus on *your* journey. Your body has unique healing to do. Give yourself grace, listen to your own body's signals, and celebrate your own progress, no matter how small. This is a marathon, not a sprint.
