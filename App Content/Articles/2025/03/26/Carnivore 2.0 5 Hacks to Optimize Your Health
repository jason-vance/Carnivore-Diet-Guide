### Hack #1: Go Nose-to-Tail (The Original Multivitamin)

While a diet of steak and ground beef is fantastic, our ancestors knew the real nutritional treasures were in the organs. Think of organ meats as nature's own, perfectly formulated supplements.
* **Liver:** This is the undisputed champion. It's packed with bioavailable **Vitamin A (retinol), B12, folate, and copper**. Don't like the taste? Try chopping a small amount of liver and mixing it into your ground beef; you'll barely notice it's there!
* **Heart:** The absolute best food source of **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)**, which is crucial for cellular energy and, you guessed it, a healthy heart.

**Action Tip:** Aim to incorporate a few ounces of organ meats into your diet once or twice a week. If you can't stomach it, desiccated organ supplements are a great alternative.

### Hack #2: Get Your Seafood Fix üêü

While beef is the king of the land, fatty fish is the king of the sea. The main reason is their incredible **Omega-3 fatty acid** content (EPA and DHA). These are superstars for:
* **Brain Health:** Your brain is hungry for DHA!
* **Reducing Inflammation:** They are powerfully anti-inflammatory.
* **Heart Health:** They support a healthy cardiovascular system.

**Action Tip:** Try to eat fatty fish like **salmon, mackerel, sardines, or herring** at least twice a week. A simple can of sardines is one of the most nutrient-dense, convenient, and affordable snacks on the planet.

### Hack #3: Fine-Tune Your Meal Timing

One of the best parts of being a fat-adapted carnivore is freedom from constant hunger. Your body is no longer on the blood sugar rollercoaster. Use this to your advantage!
* **Listen to True Hunger:** Don't eat just because the clock says it's "lunchtime." Wait until your body gives you clear hunger signals.
* **Embrace Intermittent Fasting:** You might naturally find that you feel best eating just two meals a day (2MAD) or even one meal a day (OMAD). This gives your digestive system a long break and can deepen the healing benefits of the diet.

**Action Tip:** Experiment with skipping a meal. You might be surprised to find you have incredible energy and mental clarity during a fasted state.

### Hack #4: Prioritize High-Quality Fats

Not all fats are created equal. To optimize, focus on the quality of your primary fuel source.
* **Render Your Own:** Learn to render your own **tallow** from beef suet or **lard** from pork fat. It's incredibly cheap, delicious, and free from any processing or additives.
* **Choose Grass-Fed When Possible:** Grass-fed beef and butter often have a better fatty acid profile, with more Omega-3s and CLA. It's not a requirement to succeed, but it is an optimization.

**Action Tip:** Next time you buy a brisket or a fatty roast, ask the butcher for the fat trimmings. Chop them up, put them in a slow cooker on low for a few hours, and strain the liquid fat. You now have pure, golden tallow!

### Hack #5: Master Your Minerals

You've got sodium down, but a couple of other minerals are key.
* **Potassium:** Remember that red meat and salmon are fantastic sources of this crucial electrolyte.
* **Magnesium:** Due to modern soil depletion and high-stress lives, this is one mineral many people find helpful to supplement. It's vital for muscle relaxation, sleep, and over 300 bodily functions.

**Action Tip:** If you're dealing with muscle cramps or poor sleep despite salting your food well, consider an **Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) bath** or a quality **Magnesium Glycinate** supplement before bed.
