## "But What Will You EAT?"

You're rocking the carnivore diet, feeling amazing, and then it arrives... an invitation. A friend's birthday party, a family BBQ, a work dinner. Your first thought might be a flash of panic: "What on earth am I going to eat? Will everyone think I'm weird?"

### Your Social Playbook: 4 Winning Strategies

Here are four simple strategies to make any social event a stress-free success.

#### 1. The Pro Move: Eat *Before* You Go
This is the single most powerful tool in your social toolkit. Before you head out to a party or event where you're unsure about the food, eat a big, satisfying, fatty carnivore meal at home.
* **Why it Works:** You arrive happy, full, and relaxed. You're not desperately scanning the buffet table, and you're not tempted by carby snacks because you're not even hungry! You can sip on a glass of water and focus 100% on a great conversation. If they happen to have carnivore-friendly options, it's a bonus!

#### 2. The Buffet Recon Mission üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
When you're at a party or a buffet-style event, do a quick, discreet lap to see what's on offer. You'd be surprised at what you can find!
* **What to Look For:**
    * A cheese or charcuterie board (prosciutto, salami)
    * Shrimp cocktail
    * A carving station with roast beef or turkey
    * Plain chicken wings (check for sugary sauces!)
    * Burger patties or hot dogs (skip the bun)

Politely grab what works for you and bypass the rest. No announcements or apologies needed.

#### 3. The Restaurant Rockstar ü•©
Dining out is one of the easiest parts of being a carnivore! You just have to know how to order with confidence.
* **Your Go-To Order:** Almost every restaurant in America has a steak, a burger patty, or grilled fish.
* **How to Order with a Smile:** "Hi! I'll have the ribeye, please. Could you ask the chef to cook it with just salt and no other seasonings or sauces? And no sides are necessary, thank you!" A simple, polite request is almost always handled with ease. Looking at the menu online beforehand can also help you plan your order.

#### 4. The Simple & Confident Explanation üí¨
People are curious. They will ask questions. You don't owe anyone a 30-minute lecture on nutrition science. Keep your answers short, positive, and then change the subject.
* **Them:** "Why are you only eating meat?"
* **You:** "I've found it makes me feel my absolute best! My energy has been amazing. Anyway, have you seen that new movie...?"

### A Note on Close Friends & Family
For people you're close to, give them a friendly heads-up to take the pressure off. A simple text like, "Hey! So excited for the BBQ on Saturday. Just a heads-up, I'm only eating meat for health reasons right now. I'll bring some awesome steaks to throw on the grill, so please don't worry about feeding me!"

Your health journey is yours to own. Handle social situations with a little planning and a lot of confidence, and you'll find they're not scary at all. Now go out there and have fun! üéâ
