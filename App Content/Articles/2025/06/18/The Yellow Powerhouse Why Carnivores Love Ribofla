## Shining a Light on Vitamin B2

Welcome back to our tour of the B-vitamins! Today, we're shining a spotlight on a crucial, but often overlooked, player in your health: **Riboflavin**, also known as Vitamin B2.

Here's a fun fact: Riboflavin is naturally a fluorescent yellow-orange color. It's literally a "bright" vitamin! And its role in your body is just as bright, helping to power up your cells and keep you glowing from the inside out.

Let's explore why this "yellow powerhouse" is another fantastic reason to love your carnivore diet.

### What's Riboflavin's Bright Idea?

Riboflavin is a team player, working behind the scenes to make sure your body's energy systems are running at full capacity.

* **The Energy Converter:** Just like its partner Thiamine (B1), Riboflavin is a critical part of the assembly line that converts the protein and fat from your food into pure cellular energy (ATP). If Thiamine is the spark plug, think of Riboflavin as the high-performance wiring that carries the energy current.
* **The Master Recycler:** Riboflavin is the ultimate team player. It helps activate *other* key vitamins, like B6 and folate, getting them ready to do their important jobs.
* **The Antioxidant's Ally:** It's essential for recycling a molecule called glutathione, which is known as your body's "master antioxidant." This helps protect your cells from damage and keeps them healthy.
* **The Glow-Up Vitamin:** It plays a vital role in maintaining healthy skin, hair, and eyes, contributing to that famous "carnivore glow."

## Where to Find This Powerhouse Vitamin

Forget the fortified cereals with their synthetic vitamins. The most potent and bioavailable sources of riboflavin are found right in the butcher shop and at the fish counter. Animal foods provide this crucial vitamin with no anti-nutrients to get in the way of absorption.



### Top Carnivore Sources for Riboflavin:

* **Organ Meats (The Unbeatable Champions):** Beef liver and kidney are the most riboflavin-dense foods on the planet. Nothing else even comes close!
* **Red Meat:** Beef, and especially beef heart, is a fantastic source.
* **Eggs:** The yolks are packed with B2.
* **Fatty Fish:** Salmon and mackerel are also great choices.
* **Dairy (if you tolerate it):** Hard cheeses like cheddar and parmesan contain a good amount.
