## The #1 Myth: "This Diet is Too Expensive!"

You're getting ready for your weekend grocery run, and you might be feeling a little bit of wallet-anxiety. You walk past the meat counter, see the price on those beautiful ribeye steaks, and think, "How can anyone afford to eat only meat?!"

It's the single biggest myth about the carnivore diet. But we're here to tell you that not only is it affordable, but it can often be **cheaper** than a standard diet. You just need to be a savvy shopper.

Let's break down how you can feast like a lion without needing a king's ransom.

### First, Look at What You're *Not* Buying Anymore

Before we even get to the meat, think about all the things that are no longer going into your shopping cart:
* Expensive morning lattes ‚òï
* Bags of chips, cookies, and crackers
* Sodas and sugary juices
* Craft beer and wine üç∑
* Boxes of cereal and loaves of bread
* Pricey organic produce that wilts in your fridge
* Impulse takeout lunches ü•°

You're not just adding meat to your budget; you're swapping a cart full of nutrient-poor fillers for a smaller amount of high-quality, incredibly satiating food. Plus, you'll naturally eat less often, saving even more!

## Your Budget-Friendly Carnivore Playbook üõí

Ready to shop smart? Here are the keys to the kingdom.

#### 1. Ground Beef is Your Best Friend
This is the undisputed champion of budget carnivore. It's affordable, delicious, and incredibly versatile.
* **Pro-Tip:** Buy the fattier (and cheaper!) blends like 75/25 or 80/20. Fat is your fuel! Buy it in bulk "chubs" from warehouse stores like Costco or Sam's Club for the best price.

#### 2. Embrace the "Humble" Cuts
Forget the fancy steaks for a minute and explore the cheaper, tougher cuts. When cooked low and slow, they become incredibly tender and flavorful.
* **What to Buy:** Chuck roast, beef brisket, pork shoulder (Boston butt), and beef shoulder are your new go-to's.
* **Pro-Tip:** A single large roast in the slow cooker on Sunday can provide several days' worth of delicious, shredded meat for quick meals.

#### 3. Eggs are Egg-cellent and Cheap! ü•ö
Eggs are a nutritional goldmine. For just a few dollars, you get a dozen perfect packages of high-quality protein and healthy fats. They are the ultimate budget-friendly meal, any time of day.

#### 4. Don't Be Scared of Organ Meats
Beef liver, heart, and kidney are not only the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet, they are also shockingly cheap because demand is low. A pound of beef liver often costs less than a fancy cup of coffee!
* **Pro-Tip:** If you don't love the taste of liver, ask your butcher to grind it and mix it into your ground beef. You'll get all the nutrients without the strong flavor.

#### 5. Buy in Bulk
If you have the freezer space, this is a game-changer.
* **Find a Farmer:** Look for local farms or ranches on sites like EatWild.com. Buying a quarter, half, or whole cow directly from a farmer dramatically lowers the per-pound cost of every single cut.
* **Watch the Sales:** Keep an eye on your local grocery store's weekly ads. When a good cut of meat goes on sale, stock up your freezer.

A carnivore diet doesn't have to be a daily feast of expensive steaks. By being a smart shopper and focusing on these budget-friendly staples, you can give your body the best nutrition on earth without breaking the bank. Happy feasting!
