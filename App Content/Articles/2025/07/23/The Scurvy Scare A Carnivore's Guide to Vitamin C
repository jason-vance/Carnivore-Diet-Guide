## "But You'll Get Scurvy!"

You're feeling amazing. You mention to a friend that you're only eating meat, and you see the look of horror on their face. They gasp, "But... what about Vitamin C?! You're going to get scurvy!"

Ah, the scurvy scare. It's the #1 "gotcha" question every carnivore gets. We've all seen the old-timey movies of pirates with missing teeth, and the idea of getting a medieval disease is pretty terrifying.

### The Great Glucose Competition üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è vs üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Here is the single most important thing to understand: **Vitamin C and glucose (sugar) are mortal enemies.**

They are structurally very similar, which means they compete to get into your cells using the same doorways (called GLUT transporters).

* **On a High-Carb Diet:** Imagine your cells have a single VIP entrance. When you eat carbs, a massive, rowdy mob of glucose molecules rushes the door. The few, polite Vitamin C molecules don't stand a chance; most of them can't get in. To overcome this, you need to flood your system with a huge amount of Vitamin C just to get a little bit into your cells.

* **On a Carnivore Diet:** There is no glucose mob. The VIP entrance is wide open. Every single molecule of Vitamin C you consume can waltz right in, no pushing, no shoving.

Because of this, your body's actual requirement for Vitamin C on a zero-carb diet is **drastically lower** than the standard RDAs, which are based on a high-carb population. Your body becomes incredibly efficient at using every last drop.

### Okay, But Does Meat *Actually* Have Vitamin C?

A resounding **YES!**

Fresh animal foods contain small, but sufficient, amounts of Vitamin C. It's most concentrated in organ meats, but it's present in muscle meat as well.

* **Top Sources:** Fresh liver, kidney, fish roe (eggs), and even fresh beef are all sources.
* **A Tip for Cooking:** Vitamin C is heat-sensitive. This is a fantastic reason to enjoy your steaks cooked rare to medium-rare, as this preserves more of the nutrients in the center.



### So, Do I Need a Supplement?

This is the easiest question to answer. **NO! Absolutely not.**

Not only is a Vitamin C supplement unnecessary on a well-formulated carnivore diet, but it can also be problematic. Most Vitamin C supplements are:
* Derived from corn (a grain).
* Loaded with sugar, artificial sweeteners, and other fillers.
* Likely to cause digestive upset in high doses.

Your diet provides you with the perfect amount of Vitamin C for your body's low-carb operating system.
