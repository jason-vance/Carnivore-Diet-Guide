Keto's Cooler Older Sibling: Carnivore vs. Keto

**Summary:**
Keto is great, but carnivore is simpler. We break down the key differences and why carnivore is the next level of low-carb.

## From the Same Awesome Family

You might be here because you've had amazing success with the keto diet, but you're curious if there's another level to unlock. If so, you're in the right place!

Think of the Keto and Carnivore diets as being in the same family. Keto is the popular, successful younger sibling that everyone knows. Carnivore is the cool, confident, slightly mysterious older sibling who has it all figured out.

Many, many people find their way to carnivore *through* keto. It's a natural evolution. Let's break down the family resemblance and what makes carnivore the ultimate upgrade.

### The Family Resemblance: What's the Same?

Keto and Carnivore are best friends when it comes to the big picture. Both are:

* **Low-Carb, High-Fat:** They both kick sugar and carbs to the curb and run on healthy fats.
* **Ketosis-Friendly:** Both can put your body into a state of ketosis, turning you into a fat-burning machine.
* **Hormonally Awesome:** Both are fantastic for lowering the fat-storing hormone, insulin.
* **Junk-Food Free:** Both eliminate the worst offenders of the modern diet: sugar, grains, and industrial seed oils.

## The Key Differences: Where Carnivore Levels Up ðŸš€

While they have a lot in common, carnivore takes a few key principles to the next level.

### Difference #1: The Plant Question ðŸŒ¿
* **Keto:** Allows for low-carb plants. You can have your leafy greens, avocados, nuts, seeds, and cauliflower. The main rule is keeping your net carbs low (usually under 20-50g).
* **Carnivore:** Eliminates **all** plants. The rule is simple: If it didn't have a face (or come from something with a face), you don't eat it.

### Difference #2: The Simplicity Factor ðŸ¤“
* **Keto:** Often involves tracking macros, calculating net carbs, and using apps to make sure you're staying within your limits. The question "Is this keto-friendly?" can be complicated.
* **Carnivore:** Zero tracking. Zero math. The question is simple: "Is this an animal product?" Yes? Eat until you're full. No? Don't eat it. It is the definition of beautifully simple.

### Difference #3: The Elimination of *All* Irritants
* **Keto:** While you're ditching the big inflammatory foods, you're still consuming plants that contain "anti-nutrients." Things like oxalates (in spinach and almonds), lectins, and phytates can cause digestive issues, joint pain, or skin problems for sensitive people.
* **Carnivore:** By removing all plants, you are on the ultimate elimination diet. You remove every single potential plant-based irritant. This is why people who still have nagging health issues on keto often find complete relief when they make the jump to carnivore.

## Why Make the Jump?

You might be ready to graduate from keto to carnivore if:
* You're tired of tracking macros and want ultimate freedom and simplicity.
* You still suffer from bloating, gas, or other digestive issues.
* You have a stubborn autoimmune or inflammatory condition that hasn't fully resolved.
* You're ready to see what peak health feels like on the most nutrient-dense, least inflammatory diet on the planet.

Keto is a fantastic first step away from the standard diet. Think of carnivore as the final, most powerful step on that journey. Welcome to the next level!
