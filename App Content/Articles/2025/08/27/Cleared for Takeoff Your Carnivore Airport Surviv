### Strategy #1: BYOM (Bring Your Own Meat!) üéí

This is your #1, can't-fail, stress-busting strategy. Be prepared. The TSA has no rules against delicious, solid animal foods.

**Your TSA-Approved Carry-On Feast:**
* **Beef Jerky or Biltong:** The ultimate travel snack. Just make sure it's a sugar-free brand!
* **Meat Sticks:** Brands like Chomps or PaleoValley are fantastic.
* **Cooked Bacon:** Yes, you can bring a bag of glorious, crispy bacon. Be prepared for jealous looks from the TSA agent.
* **Hard-Boiled Eggs:** A perfect, portable powerhouse of protein and fat.
* **Cold Cooked Meats:** A leftover steak or a few burger patties in a container are perfectly fine.
* **Hard Cheese:** A block of cheddar or some cheese sticks are easy and satisfying.

**Pro-Tip:** Pack your food in a clear, sealed bag. It makes the security screening process smoother.

### Strategy #2: Fast Like a Pro (The Zen Carnivore) üòé

As a fat-adapted carnivore, you have a superpower: you are not ruled by hunger. For shorter flights (anything under 6-8 hours), the easiest strategy is often to just... not eat.

* **The Benefit:** It's zero stress. You don't have to pack anything, you don't have to search for anything. You just drink water, read your book, and enjoy the flight. Arrive at your destination, then go have a proper, delicious carnivore feast.

### Strategy #3: The Airport Scavenger Hunt üßê

If you're stuck on a long layover or didn't pack enough food, it's time for a fun game. You'd be surprised what you can find if you know where to look!

* **Burger Joints:** This is your go-to. Find a Wendy's, Five Guys, or any sit-down burger place. Order a double or triple cheeseburger with bacon. The magic words are: **"No bun, no sauce, no veggies, please."**
* **Airport Restaurants & Steakhouses:** The jackpot! You can always get a steak or a piece of grilled fish. Order it cooked simply with salt and butter.
* **Breakfast All Day:** Most airports have a spot that serves breakfast all day. Order a big plate of scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausage patties.
* **Newsstands & Grab-and-Go:** In a pinch, you can usually find bags of jerky, hard-boiled eggs, or cheese sticks.

So, book that flight without fear. With a little preparation, you can cruise through any airport and airplane journey feeling energized, satisfied, and perfectly on plan. Happy travels!
