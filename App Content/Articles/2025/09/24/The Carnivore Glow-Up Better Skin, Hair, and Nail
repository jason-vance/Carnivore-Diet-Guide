### Part 1: The Beauty "Detox" (Say Goodbye to the Bad Stuff)

Before we talk about what amazing nutrients you're *adding*, let's appreciate what you're *removing*. This is often the first step to unlocking your natural radiance.

1.  **Bye-Bye, Inflammatory Foods!** Sugar, grains, industrial seed oils, and processed junk are notorious for fueling systemic inflammation. This inflammation often shows up on your skin as acne, redness, eczema, and dullness. By cutting them out, you extinguish the internal "fire."
2.  **Stable Blood Sugar, Clearer Skin:** Wild blood sugar swings can trigger hormonal imbalances, which often contribute to acne and oily skin. The carnivore diet keeps your blood sugar flat, leading to calmer skin.
3.  **Happy Gut, Happy Skin:** Many skin issues are outward signs of an unhappy gut. By healing your gut and removing irritating plant compounds, you reduce inflammation that can manifest as skin problems.
