You've had a long week, and you're probably ready for a rest. But inside your body, there's one vitamin that's still working overtime, pulling a double shift to keep you healthy. Meet **Niacin**, also known as Vitamin B3.

### Niacin's Never-Ending To-Do List

What are some of the 400+ jobs on this vitamin's busy schedule?

* **The Energy Foreman:** Like its B-vitamin cousins, Niacin is a critical manager on the job site of energy production. It helps convert the protein and fat from your food into the cellular energy (ATP) that powers your every move.
* **The DNA Repair Crew üß¨:** This is one of Niacin's coolest and most important jobs. It's essential for repairing damaged DNA, helping to protect your cells and keep your genetic blueprint in pristine condition.
* **The Circulation Booster:** Niacin plays a role in opening up blood vessels, which helps with healthy circulation. (This is what causes the famous "niacin flush" in people who take high-dose supplements!)
* **The Skin & Brain Specialist:** It's also vital for maintaining healthy skin and ensuring your brain and nervous system are communicating properly.

## The Carnivore Advantage: A Double Dose of Niacin!

Here's where being a carnivore gets really cool. You have two incredible ways to get all the niacin you need.

### 1. You Eat It Directly
Animal foods are the richest, most bioavailable sources of pre-formed niacin on the planet. Forget the "enriched" white flour; this is the real deal.

**Top Carnivore Sources:**
* **Poultry üêî:** Chicken and turkey are the undisputed champions of niacin.
* **Fish:** Tuna and salmon are also packed with it.
* **Red Meat:** A juicy steak or a serving of beef liver provides a hefty dose.
* **Pork:** Another excellent source.



### 2. Your Body Can MAKE It!
This is a carnivore superpower. Your body can actually synthesize its own niacin from an amino acid called **tryptophan**. And where do you find a ton of tryptophan? You guessed it: in high-quality animal protein like **meat, poultry, fish, and eggs.**

So, not only are you eating a diet loaded with ready-to-use niacin, but you're also providing your body with an abundance of the raw materials to create its own built-in supply. It's like having a fantastic salary *and* a trust fund!
