## The Day 3 "Hit By a Truck" Feeling

It's Day 3 of your new carnivore journey. The initial excitement has worn off, and suddenly... WHAM! You feel like you've been hit by a truck. You've got a pounding headache, you're tired, you're cranky, and maybe you're even getting some muscle cramps.

Welcome to the dreaded, but totally fixable, "Carnivore Flu."

First, let's get one thing straight: **You are not sick, and this is NOT the actual flu.** It's a sign that your body is making an amazing transition, and it's just asking for a little help. The even better news? You can usually fix it in less than 24 hours.

### What's Really Going On? The Great Flush!

So what's causing this misery? It's all about electrolytes and water.

Think of carbs in your body as a big sponge that holds onto salt and water. When you stop eating carbs, your body "wrings out" that sponge. You rapidly flush out a bunch of stored water, and a ton of crucial mineralsâ€”especially **SODIUM**â€”go right along with it.

That headache? That fatigue? Those cramps? That's just your body's way of sending up a flare signal that says, **"HEY! I NEED MORE SALT AND WATER!"**

## Your "Flu" Rescue Kit: The 3-Step Fix

Ready to feel amazing? This is your simple, 24-hour turnaround plan.

### 1. Salt is Your Savior ðŸ§‚
This is the single most important step. You need to actively replace the sodium your body is flushing out.
* **The Magic Elixir:** Mix 1/2 teaspoon of good quality, unrefined salt (like Redmond Real Salt, Celtic, or Himalayan) into a large glass of water and drink it. Do this 1-2 times a day.
* **Salt Your Food Liberally:** Don't be shy with the salt shaker on your steaks and burgers! Your salt cravings are real signals; listen to them.

### 2. Water is Your Wingman ðŸ’§
You're losing water, so you need to drink water. Simple as that.
* **The Goal:** Aim to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Staying hydrated is key to helping your body adjust and keeping energy levels up. Remember, salt and water work as a team!

### 3. Fat is Your Fuel ðŸ§ˆ
Your body is in the middle of a massive fuel system upgradeâ€”switching from running on carbs to running on fat. This process takes energy.
* **The Solution:** Don't undereat! If you feel tired or weak, eat a fatty meal. A few strips of bacon, a juicy 80/20 burger patty, or a steak with a generous pat of butter will provide the new fuel your body is learning to love.

This "flu" is a temporary bump in the road. For most people who follow these steps, the symptoms vanish in a day or two. On the other side of this little hurdle is the incredible, stable, all-day energy that makes this way of eating so amazing.

So drink your salty water, eat your fatty meat, and get ready to thrive!
