### Your 60-Minute Game Plan ‚è±Ô∏è

Set a timer for one hour this weekend. Put on some music. Let's do this.

#### Task 1: The Ground Beef Goldmine (20 minutes)
Ground beef is your best friend. It's affordable, versatile, and the foundation of a stress-free week.
* **The Mission:** In your largest skillet or pot, brown 3-5 pounds of ground beef. Salt it generously as it cooks.
* **The Result:** A big container of ready-to-eat, delicious ground beef. You now have the base for instant "carnivore bowls" for lunch or dinner all week long.

#### Task 2: The Slow Cooker Hero (10 minutes prep)
This is the definition of "set it and forget it." While your ground beef is browning, get this going.
* **The Mission:** Grab a 3-4 pound chuck roast, pork shoulder, or beef brisket. Pat it dry, salt it liberally on all sides, and place it in your slow cooker. Set it on low for 8 hours.
* **The Result:** You'll come back to a house that smells amazing and meat that is so tender it falls apart with a fork. Shred it up and store it.

#### Task 3: The Bacon Bonanza (20 minutes)
Cooking bacon in a pan is messy and slow. The oven is your secret weapon.
* **The Mission:** Line one or two large baking sheets with parchment paper (for easy cleanup!). Lay out an entire package of bacon in a single layer. Bake at 400¬∞F (200¬∞C) for 15-20 minutes, or until it reaches your perfect level of crispiness.
* **The Result:** A whole batch of perfectly cooked bacon, ready for quick breakfasts, snacks, or to crumble over your ground beef.

#### Task 4 (Bonus!): The Eggcellent Add-On (10 minutes)
* **The Mission:** While everything else is cooking, hard-boil a dozen eggs.
* **The Result:** The ultimate portable carnivore snack, ready to go whenever you need it.
