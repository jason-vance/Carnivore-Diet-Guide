Ever feel like you’re living in a permanent state of jet lag, even though you haven't left your zip code in six months? You might be fighting your own biology.

We call it the **Circadian Rhythm**, but think of it as your body’s master schedule. It tells you when to wake up, when to hunt (or open the fridge), and when to pass out. For many people on the Standard American Diet, this clock is broken. The good news? The Carnivore Diet might just be the repair kit you need.

#### The Blood Sugar Rollercoaster vs. The Steady Train
One of the biggest disruptors of deep sleep is unstable blood sugar. When you eat a heavy carb dinner, your insulin spikes, then crashes in the middle of the night. This crash triggers a release of **cortisol** (the stress hormone) and adrenaline to bring your sugar levels back up.

Result? You wake up at 3:00 AM staring at the ceiling, wondering if you forgot to reply to that one email.

On Carnivore, your blood glucose is essentially a flat line. No sugar crashes means no cortisol spikes in the middle of the night. You stay in deep, restorative sleep because your body isn't panicking about fuel.

#### The Meat-Melatonin Connection
You’ve heard of Melatonin—the "sleepy time" hormone. But did you know you need specific building blocks to make it?

It starts with an amino acid called **Tryptophan**.
1.  **Tryptophan** converts into **Serotonin** (the "feel good" neurotransmitter).
2.  **Serotonin** converts into **Melatonin** (the "go to sleep" hormone).

Guess what is packed with bioavailable Tryptophan? **Red meat, eggs, and fish.**

By eating a diet rich in these amino acids, you are giving your brain the raw materials it needs to naturally regulate your sleep-wake cycle without relying on synthetic supplements.

#### Entrainment: Setting the Clock
Your Circadian Rhythm is "entrained" (synchronized) by two main things: **Light** and **Food**.

* **Light:** Our ancestors woke up with the sun. Try to get 10 minutes of sunlight in your eyes (no sunglasses!) first thing in the morning. It signals your brain that the day has started.
* **Food:** Eating is a signal to your body that it’s "active time." If you are eating a massive steak at 11:00 PM, you are telling your body to wake up and digest. Try to finish your last meal 3–4 hours before bed to let your heart rate drop and your body cool down for sleep.

#### The Bottom Line
When you cut the carbs and prioritize animal fats and proteins, you aren't just fixing your gut or your waistline; you are recalibrating your body's timing mechanisms. So, eat that ribeye, get some sun, and enjoy the best sleep of your life.
