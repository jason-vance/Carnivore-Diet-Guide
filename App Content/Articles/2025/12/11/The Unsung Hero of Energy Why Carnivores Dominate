### **The Unsung Hero of Energy: Why Carnivores Dominate the Vitamin B5 Game**

If you’ve ever wondered what turns that delicious ribeye into the raw energy you use to crush a workout (or just wrangle toddlers), say hello to **Vitamin B5**, also known as **Pantothenic Acid**.

While the nutrition world often obsesses over flashy vitamins like B12 or C, humble B5 is the workhorse behind the scenes. And the good news? If you are living that carnivore life, you are likely swimming in it.

#### **What is Vitamin B5 Anyway?**
The name comes from the Greek word *pantothen*, meaning "from everywhere." It was named that because small amounts of it are found in almost every food group. But—and this is a big "but"—it is most concentrated and bioavailable in the animal kingdom.

**B5 is the ultimate fuel injector.** Its main job is to synthesize **Coenzyme A (CoA)**, which is essential for fatty acid metabolism. In plain English: it helps your body melt down fat and convert it into pure, unadulterated energy. If you are eating high-fat and low-carb, B5 is your best friend.

#### **The Carnivore Advantage**
Vegans often have to scramble to combine various grains and veggies to hit their B-vitamin quotas. Carnivores? We just eat dinner.

Because B5 is abundant in animal tissues, a standard carnivore diet provides plenty of it without the need for synthetic supplements or fortified cereals.

#### **Top Carnivore Sources of Vitamin B5**
Want to make sure your tank is topped off? Here are the heavy hitters:

* **Liver (The King):** Just 3 ounces of beef liver provides over 60% of your daily recommended value. It is nature’s multivitamin for a reason.
* **Kidney:** Another organ meat powerhouse that is packed with B5.
* **Egg Yolks:** Don't toss the yellow! That’s where the liquid gold lives.
* **Beef & Pork:** Good old-fashioned muscle meat is a solid source. A hearty steak dinner gets you a long way toward your daily goal.
* **Chicken & Turkey:** Poultry, specifically the dark meat, is surprisingly rich in B5.

> **Pro Tip:** Vitamin B5 is water-soluble and can be sensitive to heat. Cooking your meat rare or medium-rare (if safe and to your taste) helps preserve more of that vitamin goodness than turning it into a hockey puck.

#### **The "Burning Feet" Warning**
True B5 deficiency is incredibly rare, mostly because B5 is in almost everything. However, severe deficiency can lead to something called "burning feet syndrome" (numbness and burning in the feet).

The reality? You’d have to try *very* hard to become deficient while feasting on steak and eggs.

#### **The Bottom Line**
Vitamin B5 keeps your metabolism humming, your skin healthy, and your energy levels high. While the rest of the world hunts for supplements, you can just hunt for a good butcher. Keep searing those steaks and enjoying your eggs—your B5 levels are in good hands.
