Let’s be real for a second. You saw the transformation photos. You heard about the mental clarity. You bought enough ribeyes to bankrupt a small village. You were ready for the "Lion Diet" life.

You were *not*, however, ready for the sprint to the bathroom at 3:00 AM wondering if your insides have decided to liquidate their assets.

In the carnivore community, we affectionately call this **"Disaster Pants."** It is the great equalizer. Whether you are a CEO or a mechanic, nobody looks dignified clenching their way to the nearest restroom.

The good news? It’s totally normal, it’s usually temporary, and we can fix it. Here is why your gut is throwing a tantrum and how to calm it down.

### Why is this happening to me?

You aren't dying; you're just adapting. Here are the three usual suspects causing the turbulence:

**1. The Microbiome Mutiny**
Your gut is currently housing billions of bacteria that thrive on fiber, sugar, and carbs. When you suddenly cut off their food supply, they die off. Rapidly. As the old guard leaves and the new "meat-loving" bacteria move in, things get... chaotic. This biological civil war often results in loose stools.

**2. The "Rendered Fat" Rookie Mistake**
This is the #1 culprit. When you cook a fatty steak or ground beef, a lot of that fat melts into liquid (rendered fat). If you pour that hot, delicious grease over your meat and eat it, it hits your system like a slip-and-slide. Your body digests solid fat much better than liquid fat.

**3. The Bile bottleneck**
To digest fat, your liver produces bile. If you are coming from a low-fat diet, your gallbladder is like a muscle that hasn't been to the gym in years. It’s weak. It can't pump out enough bile to handle that 16oz Ribeye yet. Undigested fat acts as a laxative. (Fun, right?)

### How to Fix the Flow

Put down the Imodium and try these natural adjustments first.

#### 🛑 Stop Drinking the Grease
This is the golden rule. If there is a pool of liquid fat on your plate, **do not drink it.**
* **The Fix:** Let your meat rest until the fat solidifies, or (painful as it sounds) discard the excess rendered fat in the pan until your digestion adjusts. Eat the solid fat on the steak; skip the liquid gold for now.

#### 💊 Check Your Magnesium
Are you supplementing electrolytes? Magnesium Citrate and Magnesium Oxide are notorious for loosening bowels (they are literally used as laxatives in higher doses).
* **The Fix:** Switch to **Magnesium Glycinate**, which is much gentler on the stomach, or pause the supplements for a few days to see if things firm up.

#### 🐢 Slow Down on Water Near Meals
Drinking a gallon of water right while you are eating dilutes your stomach acid and enzymes, making digestion harder.
* **The Fix:** Try not to drink heavily 30 minutes before or after your meal. Give your stomach acid a fighting chance to break down that beef.

#### 🥩 Eat Leaner (Just for a bit)
I know, "fat is fuel." But if you are having emergencies, your body is telling you it can't handle the fuel load yet.
* **The Fix:** Swap the ribeye for sirloin or round steak for a few days. Gradually re-introduce the fattier cuts as your gut stabilizes.

### The Golden Rule of Adaptation

**Never Trust a Fart.**
Seriously. Not for the first 30 days. Just don't do it.

### The Bottom Line (Pun Intended)
This phase usually lasts anywhere from a few days to two weeks. It is your body’s way of clearing out the junk and re-tooling for high-performance fuel. Stay hydrated, keep your salts up, and maybe keep a spare pair of pants in the car. You’ve got this!
