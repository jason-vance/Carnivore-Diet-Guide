### **Article Body**

So, you’ve ditched the plants, stocked up on ribeyes, and you’re feeling like an apex predator. But then, it happens—you wake up at 2:00 AM gripping your calf muscle in agony, or maybe you just feel a little "meh" walking up a flight of stairs.

Before you panic and think the meat life isn't for you, let’s talk about the unsung hero of the electrolyte world: **Potassium**.

#### **The Great Electrolyte Dump**

When you switch to a Carnivore diet, your body stops hoarding water. Without carbohydrates to spike your insulin, your kidneys get the signal to flush out excess fluid. This is great for looking lean, but that water takes valuable electrolytes—specifically Sodium and Potassium—along for the ride.

If you don't replenish them, you enter the dreaded "Keto Flu" zone.

#### **Signs You Might Be Low**

Potassium works hand-in-hand with sodium to keep your cells happy and your muscles firing. If you are running low, your body might send you some of these not-so-fun signals:

* **Muscle Cramps:** Especially in the legs or feet (the classic "Charley horse").
* **Fatigue:** Feeling like you’re walking through mud.
* **Heart Palpitations:** A fluttery feeling in your chest.
* **Brain Fog:** Forgetting where you put your keys... again.

#### **Doesn't Meat Have Potassium?**

Yes! Meat is actually a fantastic source of potassium. A nice juicy steak, pork, and even salmon are packed with it.

However, during the adaptation phase (the first few weeks or months), your body is flushing electrolytes faster than you can chew through a Tomahawk steak. This is where a little supplementation can save the day.

#### **How to Supplement (Without Bananas)**

Forget the bananas—they are just sugar bombs in a yellow jacket. Here is how to get your potassium fix the carnivore way:

1. **Lite Salt / NoSalt:** This is the secret weapon of veteran carnivores. Look for salt substitutes at the grocery store that are made of **Potassium Chloride**. You can mix a small amount into water (start small!) or sprinkle it on your meat alongside your regular salt.
2. **Pork Belly & Salmon:** If you want to stick to whole foods, lean heavily into pork and fish, which are naturally higher in potassium than some other cuts.
3. **Electrolyte Powders:** If you prefer a pre-made mix, look for unsweetened electrolyte powders. Just double-check the label to ensure they actually contain a meaningful amount of potassium (aim for at least 200mg-500mg per serving).

#### **A Word of Caution**

More is not always better! Potassium is powerful stuff. Taking too much at once can upset your stomach or cause heart issues. **Always start low and go slow.** Never chug a spoonful of potassium powder; sip it throughout the day.
