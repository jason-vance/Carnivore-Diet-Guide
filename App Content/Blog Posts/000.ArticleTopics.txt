Planning and budgeting for a meat-centric diet

Comparison with other diets (e.g., keto, paleo)

	The carnivore diet offers several distinct benefits over the ketogenic (keto) and paleolithic (paleo) diets, particularly for individuals seeking simplicity and specific health outcomes. One of the primary advantages is its extreme simplicity and ease of meal planning. The carnivore diet eliminates the need to count macros or calories, a common requirement in the keto diet, and does not involve the intricate food sourcing and preparation often associated with the paleo diet. This simplicity can be appealing for those who prefer a straightforward, no-frills approach to eating.

	Moreover, the carnivore diet is often reported to provide rapid and significant results in terms of weight loss and improved digestion. The absence of all plant-based foods means eliminating common dietary irritants and allergens, which can be beneficial for individuals with autoimmune diseases or digestive issues unresponsive to other dietary changes. Unlike the keto diet, which requires maintaining a delicate balance of macronutrients to stay in ketosis, or the paleo diet, which still includes a variety of food groups, the carnivore diet's all-meat approach might lead to a more consistent metabolic state, potentially offering more consistent energy levels and mental clarity.

	Additionally, the carnivore diet's focus on high-quality animal products ensures a rich intake of certain nutrients like B vitamins, iron, and essential amino acids, which are highly bioavailable from animal sources. While the keto and paleo diets also include these nutrients, the carnivore diet's exclusive focus on animal products might offer higher concentrations and better absorption of these nutrients.

Origins and Historical Context of the Carnivore Diet

	The origins and historical context of the carnivore diet can be traced back to various periods and cultures, although it has gained modern popularity relatively recently.

	Prehistoric Diets: 
		The concept of a meat-centric diet has roots in the eating habits of our prehistoric ancestors. Early humans were hunter-gatherers, with a significant portion of their diet likely consisting of animal products, especially in regions where plant-based foods were scarce. This era forms the basis of the belief that a meat-based diet is aligned with human evolutionary nutrition.

	Indigenous Cultures: 
		Various indigenous groups around the world have traditionally relied heavily on animal products. For example, the Inuit people in the Arctic, the Maasai tribe in East Africa, and the Mongolian nomads. These cultures have diets rich in meats and animal fats due to geographical and environmental factors that limited access to a wide variety of plant foods.

	Historical Diets and Health Movements: 
		Throughout history, there have been several health movements and diets that emphasized meat consumption. For instance, in the 19th century, the "Banting" diet, proposed by William Banting, recommended a diet low in carbohydrates, high in fat, and moderate in protein, mostly from animal sources.

	Modern Carnivore Movement: 
		In recent years, the carnivore diet has been popularized by various nutritionists, health bloggers, and enthusiasts who advocate for a return to a more 'natural' human diet. This modern interpretation often focuses on potential health benefits like weight loss, improved digestion, and relief from autoimmune diseases.

	Contemporary Interest: 
		The diet has gained traction in the context of rising interest in low-carb and ketogenic diets, as people search for alternatives to standard dietary guidelines that they feel have not served their health needs adequately.

	It's important to note that while these historical and cultural practices provide context, the modern carnivore diet as popularized today is a relatively new phenomenon and differs in various ways from the diets of our ancestors or traditional cultures, particularly in terms of the variety and processing of meat consumed.
