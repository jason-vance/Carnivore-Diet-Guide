Content:
### **Ingredients:**
- 1 ribeye, sirloin, or New York strip steak (about 1 to 1.5 inches thick)
- 1-2 tbsp butter, ghee, or tallow (for searing)
- Sea salt (to taste)
- Optional: black pepper (if you're okay with it)

### **Instructions:**

1. **Prep the Steak:**
   - Take the steak out of the fridge about 30 minutes before cooking to let it come to room temperature. This helps it cook more evenly.
   - Pat the steak dry with paper towels to remove any moisture. This is key for getting a nice sear!
   - Generously season both sides with **sea salt**. If you want, sprinkle a bit of black pepper too.

2. **Heat the Pan:**
   - Heat a cast-iron skillet or heavy frying pan over medium-high heat. You want the pan **very hot** before adding the steak.
   - Once hot, add 1-2 tablespoons of **butter, ghee, or tallow**. The fat should melt and start to shimmer quickly.

3. **Sear the Steak:**
   - Carefully place the steak in the hot pan. You should hear a satisfying sizzle—this is how you get that golden-brown crust!
   - **Sear for 3-4 minutes** on the first side, without moving the steak. You’ll know it’s ready to flip when it easily releases from the pan.
   - **Flip the steak** and cook for another 2-4 minutes, depending on how well done you like it. For medium-rare, aim for about 2-3 minutes per side.
   
4. **Check for Doneness:**
   - For **medium-rare**, the internal temperature should be around **130°F (54°C)**. You can use a meat thermometer for accuracy or just go by feel: soft for rare, firm for well-done.
   - If you prefer, you can also sear the edges by holding the steak with tongs and rolling the sides in the hot pan for about 30 seconds each.

5. **Rest and Serve:**
   - Remove the steak from the pan and let it **rest for 5 minutes**. This allows the juices to redistribute, keeping your steak tender and juicy.
   - Serve as is, or with a little extra melted butter on top!

### **Carnivore Tip:**
To get a perfect crust, resist the urge to move the steak around in the pan—just let it sear undisturbed.

### **Enjoy!**
This simple seared steak is the perfect carnivore-friendly meal for beginners—easy to cook, rich in flavor, and packed with protein and healthy fats.
