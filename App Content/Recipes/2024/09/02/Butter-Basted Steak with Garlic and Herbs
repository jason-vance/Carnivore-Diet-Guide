### **Ingredients:**
- 1 ribeye, sirloin, or New York strip steak (about 1 to 1.5 inches thick)
- 3 tbsp butter (or ghee/tallow)
- 2 garlic cloves, smashed (optional if you want to avoid plants)
- 2-3 sprigs of fresh thyme or rosemary (optional)
- Sea salt (to taste)
- Optional: black pepper (if you’re okay with it)

### **Instructions:**

1. **Prep the Steak:**
   - Take the steak out of the fridge about 30 minutes before cooking to bring it to room temperature.
   - Pat the steak dry with paper towels.
   - Generously season both sides with **sea salt** (and black pepper if you’re using it).

2. **Sear the Steak:**
   - Heat a cast-iron skillet over **medium-high heat** until hot.
   - Add 1 tablespoon of **butter** (or ghee/tallow) and let it melt.
   - Place the steak in the pan and sear for **3-4 minutes** on the first side, without moving it, until a golden-brown crust forms.

3. **Flip and Butter-Baste:**
   - Flip the steak and sear the other side for **2-3 minutes**.
   - Add the remaining butter, garlic cloves, and herbs (thyme or rosemary) to the pan.
   - As the butter melts and foams, tilt the pan slightly and use a spoon to **baste the steak** with the melted butter. Continuously spoon the butter over the steak for **2-3 minutes**.

4. **Check for Doneness:**
   - For **medium-rare**, the internal temperature should be around **130°F (54°C)**. You can use a meat thermometer or check by feel.
   - Sear the edges for about 30 seconds if needed for a more even crust.

5. **Rest and Serve:**
   - Remove the steak from the pan and let it **rest for 5 minutes**.
   - Slice and serve with the garlic and herbs on the side for extra flavor.
