Content:
### **Ingredients:**
- 2 salmon fillets (preferably wild-caught)
- 2 tbsp butter, ghee, or tallow (for frying)
- Sea salt (to taste)
- Optional: lemon wedges (if you’re okay with a touch of citrus)

### **Instructions:**

1. **Prep the Salmon:**
   - Pat the salmon fillets dry with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture.
   - Season both sides of the salmon generously with sea salt. Feel free to sprinkle some black pepper if you're okay with it.

2. **Heat the Pan:**
   - In a large frying pan, heat your **butter, ghee, or tallow** over medium-high heat until it’s hot and shimmering. You want the fat to be hot enough to give the salmon a nice crispy sear.

3. **Fry the Salmon:**
   - Place the salmon fillets skin-side down in the pan. Cook for about 4-5 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets, until the skin becomes crispy and the salmon is cooked about halfway up.
   - Flip the fillets carefully and cook the other side for another 2-4 minutes, depending on how well-done you like your salmon. If you prefer it more medium-rare, you can reduce the cooking time slightly.

4. **Rest and Serve:**
   - Once cooked, remove the salmon from the pan and let it rest for a minute or two. This helps lock in the juices.
   - Serve the fried salmon as is or with optional lemon wedges to squeeze on top for a zesty touch (totally optional).

### **Carnivore Tip:**
For extra crispy skin, press down gently on the salmon with a spatula during the first few minutes of cooking, ensuring even contact with the pan.

### **Enjoy!**
