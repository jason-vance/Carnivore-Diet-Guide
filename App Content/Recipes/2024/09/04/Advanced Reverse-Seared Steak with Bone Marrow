Content:
### **Ingredients:**
- 1 thick-cut ribeye or tomahawk steak (about 1.5-2 inches thick)
- 2 tbsp tallow or ghee (for searing)
- Sea salt (to taste)
- Optional: black pepper (if you’re okay with it)

**For the Bone Marrow Butter:**
- 2 marrow bones (roasted)
- 2 tbsp butter (softened)
- Sea salt (to taste)

### **Instructions:**

#### **Step 1: Prepare the Steak**
- **Bring the steak to room temperature**: Take the steak out of the fridge about 30-60 minutes before cooking to let it come to room temperature.
- **Season generously**: Season the steak with sea salt (and black pepper if desired) on both sides.

#### **Step 2: Roast the Bone Marrow**
- Preheat the oven to **450°F (230°C)**.
- Place the marrow bones on a baking tray and roast for about **15-20 minutes** until the marrow is soft and starts to melt.
- Once done, scoop out the marrow and mix it with softened butter. Add salt to taste. Set aside for later.

#### **Step 3: Reverse Sear the Steak**
1. **Preheat the oven to 250°F (120°C)**.
2. Place the steak on a wire rack set over a baking sheet.
3. Bake the steak in the oven for about **30-40 minutes** until the internal temperature reaches **120-125°F (50°C)** for medium-rare (adjust time for your preferred doneness). This slow cooking method ensures even doneness throughout the steak.
4. Remove the steak from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.

#### **Step 4: Sear the Steak**
- Heat a cast-iron skillet over **high heat** and add **tallow or ghee**.
- Once the pan is screaming hot, place the steak in the pan and sear for **1-2 minutes per side**, creating a crispy, golden-brown crust.
- Sear the edges for about 30 seconds to get an even crust all around.

#### **Step 5: Serve with Bone Marrow Butter**
- Top the steak with a dollop of **bone marrow butter** for extra richness and flavor.
- Slice and serve immediately, savoring every bite of that perfectly reverse-seared, juicy steak!
