Content:
### **Ingredients:**
- 2 lbs (about 900g) of beef bones (marrow bones, knuckle bones, oxtail, or a combination)
- 1-2 tbsp apple cider vinegar (optional, helps draw nutrients from the bones)
- Sea salt (to taste)
- Water (enough to cover the bones)

### **Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Bones:**
   - If you want extra flavor, you can **roast the bones** in the oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 30 minutes before making the broth. This step is optional but adds depth to the flavor.
   
2. **Add the Ingredients to a Pot:**
   - Place the bones in a large stockpot or slow cooker. Add **water** to cover the bones by about 1-2 inches. If you’re using apple cider vinegar, add it now (it helps extract more nutrients from the bones).
   - Let the bones and vinegar sit in the water for 30 minutes before heating.

3. **Simmer the Broth:**
   - Heat the pot over medium-high heat until the water comes to a gentle boil.
   - Reduce the heat to low and let the broth **simmer for 12-24 hours**. The longer it simmers, the more nutrients you’ll extract from the bones.
   - Throughout the cooking process, skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the top.
   
4. **Season the Broth:**
   - Add sea salt to taste once the broth is done cooking. You can also adjust the salt later when serving.

5. **Strain and Store:**
   - After 12-24 hours, remove the pot from the heat and let the broth cool slightly.
   - Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a large bowl or container to remove the bones and any solids.
   - Store the broth in the fridge for up to a week, or freeze it for longer storage.

### **Beginner Tip:**
The longer you simmer the bones, the richer and more flavorful the broth will become. If you have a slow cooker, it’s the easiest way to let it cook for an extended time without needing to watch it.

Enjoy your simple, nutrient-packed **bone broth**—great for sipping on its own or adding to other carnivore dishes!
