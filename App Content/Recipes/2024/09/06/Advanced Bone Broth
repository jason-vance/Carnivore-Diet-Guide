Content:
### **Ingredients:**
- 2 lbs beef marrow bones
- 1 lb beef knuckle or joint bones (for extra collagen)
- 1 lb oxtail (for flavor and richness)
- 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar (optional, helps extract nutrients)
- Sea salt (to taste)
- Water (enough to cover the bones)

### **Instructions:**

#### **Step 1: Roast the Bones**
1. **Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C)**.
2. Spread the marrow, knuckle, and oxtail bones on a baking sheet and roast them for **30 minutes**, turning once halfway through. This caramelizes the bones and intensifies the flavor.

#### **Step 2: Add the Bones to a Pot**
1. Place the roasted bones in a large stockpot or slow cooker.
2. Add enough water to cover the bones by about 1-2 inches.
3. If using apple cider vinegar, pour it into the pot and let the bones soak for 30 minutes before heating (this helps extract minerals).

#### **Step 3: Simmer the Broth**
1. Bring the pot to a gentle boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer.
2. Let the broth simmer for **24-36 hours**. The longer it simmers, the more nutrients and collagen you’ll extract. 
3. Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the top during the first few hours of simmering.

#### **Step 4: Reduce for Richness (Optional)**
1. After simmering, remove the bones and strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve.
2. If you want to intensify the flavor and make the broth more concentrated, return the strained broth to the pot and simmer it for another **1-2 hours** to reduce it by half.

#### **Step 5: Season and Store**
1. Add sea salt to taste once the broth is done cooking.
2. Let the broth cool slightly, then store it in the refrigerator for up to a week or freeze for longer storage.
3. You can skim off the fat layer from the top once it’s chilled, or leave it for a richer broth.

### **Advanced Tips:**
- Use **joint and knuckle bones** for extra collagen, which is great for joint health and gut support.
- Roasting the bones before simmering adds an extra depth of flavor to the broth.
- **Reducing** the broth after straining makes it more concentrated and rich, perfect for sipping or adding to dishes.

Enjoy your nutrient-packed **bone broth**! This recipe will provide you with a collagen-boosting, flavorful broth that's great for sipping or as a base for other carnivore meals.
