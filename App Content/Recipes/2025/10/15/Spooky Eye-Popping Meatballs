* 2-3 tbsp tallow or butter for cooking

## Instructions:

1.  **Prep the Meatballs:** In a large bowl, gently mix the ground beef with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder (if using). Don't overmix, or your meatballs will be tough!
2.  **Form the Eyeballs:** Roll the meat mixture into 12-15 uniform "eyeballs" â€“ slightly larger than a golf ball.
3.  **Sear the Meatballs:** Heat the tallow or butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the meatballs, searing them on all sides until nicely browned. This will create a delicious crust and help them hold their shape.
4.  **Cook Through:** Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the skillet, and let the meatballs cook through for about 10-15 minutes, or until cooked to your desired doneness. Uncover for the last few minutes if you prefer a crispier exterior.
5.  **Create the Iris:** While the meatballs are cooking, use a small, round cookie cutter (or the wider end of a piping tip/straw) to cut 12-15 small circles from your cheese slices. These will be the "irises" of your spooky eyes.
6.  **Add the Pupils:** If using, slice your black olives into small rounds or halves to create the "pupils." If omitting olives, you can use a tiny, seared piece of liver or just leave the cheese as the pupil-less iris!
7.  **Assemble the Eyes:** Once the meatballs are cooked, remove them from the heat. Place one cheese "iris" circle on top of each warm meatball. The residual heat will slightly melt the cheese, helping it adhere.
8.  **Final Touch:** Gently place one olive "pupil" in the center of each cheese iris.
9.  **Serve Spooky!** Arrange your Spooky Eye-Popping Meatballs on a platter and watch your carnivore ghouls and goblins devour them!
