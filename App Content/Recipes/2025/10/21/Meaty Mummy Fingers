## Instructions:

1.  **Preheat Your Lair:** Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
2.  **Prepare the Rack:** Place a wire cooling rack on top of a large, rimmed baking sheet. This allows the bacon fat to drip away, making your mummies crispy on all sides!
3.  **Wrap the Mummies:** Take one sausage link. Starting from the bottom, wrap one slice of thin-cut bacon around it like a mummy's bandage. Leave a small gap near the top for the "face" area. The bacon should stick to itself, but you can use a toothpick to secure it if needed (just remember to remove it before serving!).
4.  **Add a Fingernail (Optional):** For an extra creepy touch, press a tiny, flat piece of seared beef liver or a small, dark piece of crispy bacon onto the tip of the sausage to create a ghoulish fingernail.
5.  **Arrange for Baking:** Place each wrapped "mummy finger" on the wire rack, making sure they aren't touching.
6.  **Bake to Perfection:** Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the bacon is golden brown and crispy to your liking.
7.  **Serve the Spooks:** Let the mummy fingers cool for a few minutes before handling. Arrange them on a platter like a severed hand for maximum Halloween effect! They are the perfect spooky finger food for your carnivorous festivities.
