* Salt to taste
* **Optional "Blood" Effect:** A few drops of natural red food coloring (many are made from cochineal, an insect, making them technically carnivore-friendly for some).

## Instructions:

1.  **Prep the Guts:** If your sausage is in a large coil, great! If it's in individual links, you can either cook them as is or carefully remove the casings to have one long rope of sausage meat to work with (this is messier but looks great!).
2.  **Heat the Cauldron:** Melt the tallow or lard in a large skillet or cast-iron pan over medium-high heat.
3.  **Cook the Guts:** Carefully place the rope sausage into the hot pan, allowing it to coil and twist naturally. If using links, arrange them in a crowded, messy pile. Brown the sausage on all sides, turning it gently to keep the "gut" shape as intact as possible.
4.  **Simmer and Steam:** Once the sausage is browned, reduce the heat to medium-low. You can add a tablespoon of water and cover the pan for about 10 minutes to ensure the inside is cooked through. Uncover for the last few minutes to crisp it up again.
5.  **Add the "Blood" (Optional):** In the last minute of cooking, if you want a gorier effect, you can mix a few drops of red food coloring into the rendered fat in the pan and spoon it over the sausage.
6.  **Serve the Horror:** Carefully transfer the coiled sausage "guts" onto a platter. The messier and more jumbled it looks, the better! Serve hot to your horrified and hungry guests.
