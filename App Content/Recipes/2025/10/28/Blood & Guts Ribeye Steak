### Ingredients

* 2 (approx. 12 oz each) thick-cut Ribeye Steaks, or other preferred cut.
* 4 Tbsp Beef Tallow (or butter/lard)
* 1 Tbsp Beef Bone Marrow (optional, for extra richness)
* 1/2 tsp Salt (more to taste)
* 1/4 tsp finely crushed Beetroot Powder* (for "blood" color only, *see notes*)
* 1/4 tsp Beef Blood Powder or Dried Liver Powder (optional, for deep color/flavor, *see notes*)

### Instructions

1.  **Prep the Steaks:** Pat the steaks completely dry with a paper towel. Season generously on both sides with salt. Allow the steaks to sit at room temperature for 30-45 minutes before cooking (if time allows) for a better sear.
2.  **Make the "Blood" Fat:** In a small, heat-safe bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the beef tallow (or butter/lard) with the crushed beetroot powder and/or beef blood/liver powder (if using). Stir until a vibrant red paste forms. Set aside.
3.  **Sear the Steaks:** In a large cast-iron or heavy-bottomed skillet, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of tallow over high heat until it shimmers and is just about to smoke.
4.  **Cook:** Carefully place the steaks in the hot skillet. Sear undisturbed for 3-4 minutes per side until a deep brown crust forms.
5.  **Baste & Finish:** Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the bone marrow (if using) to the pan. Tilt the pan and use a spoon to continuously baste the melted fat and marrow over the top of the steaks for 3-5 minutes, or until the steaks reach your desired internal temperature (e.g., $130^{\circ}\text{F}$ for Medium-Rare).
6.  **Rest:** Remove the steaks from the pan and let them rest on a cutting board for 5-10 minutes.
7.  **Assemble the "Guts":** While the steaks are resting, slightly reheat the vibrant "blood" fat mixture from Step 2.
8.  **Serve Spooky Style:** Slice the steaks against the grain. Arrange the slices on a platter or plate. Drizzle the warm "blood" fat mixture over the steak slices to resemble fresh blood, pooling in the center. Serve immediately.

**\*Carnivore Notes:**
* **Beetroot/Liver Powder:** Pure carnivore followers may omit all powders for strict compliance, as beetroot is a plant, and liver powder is an organ (though both are often included in 'strict' variations for seasoning or nutrient density). For the visual Halloween effect, the *minimal* amount of beetroot powder used primarily for color can be considered a personal compliance choice.
* **Fat Choice:** Tallow is preferred for high-heat searing, but butter will also work and can add flavor; just watch the heat to prevent burning.
* **Bloody Effect:** The "blood" fat is best when the fat remains liquid for drizzling. If it solidifies too quickly, gently warm it again before serving.
