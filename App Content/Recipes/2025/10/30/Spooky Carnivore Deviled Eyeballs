### ðŸ“œ Instructions
1.  **Hard-Boil Eggs:** Place the 12 eggs in a large pot and cover them with water. Bring to a rolling boil, then turn off the heat, cover the pot, and let sit for 10-12 minutes.
2.  **Cool & Peel:** Transfer the eggs to an ice bath to stop the cooking. Once cool, carefully peel all 12 eggs.
3.  **Prep Eggs:** Slice each egg in half lengthwise. Gently scoop out all the yolks into a medium-sized bowl. Arrange the 24 egg-white halves on a serving platter.
4.  **Make Filling:** Mash the egg yolks with a fork until they are a fine powder. Add the melted tallow (or other fat), crushed pork rinds (if using), and salt. Stir vigorously until the mixture is smooth and creamy.
5.  **Fill "Eyeballs":** Spoon or pipe the yolk mixture back into the center of each egg-white half, mounding it slightly to create the "iris."
6.  **Add Pupils:** Place one small piece of cooked bacon or beef jerky in the very center of the yellow yolk filling to create the "pupil."
7.  **Serve:** Chill until ready to serve. For an extra "bloodshot" effect, you can drizzle a tiny bit of reddish bacon grease over the whites.
