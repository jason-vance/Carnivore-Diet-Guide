### Ingredients

* 2 large beef shanks (Osso Buco cut), about 1.5 lbs total
* 2-3 large "canoe cut" beef marrow bones (about 6-8 inches)
* 3 tbsp beef tallow, ghee, or butter
* 2 cups beef bone broth (or water)
* Salt to taste

### Instructions

1.  **Preheat & Sear:** Preheat your oven to 325째F (165째C). Pat the beef shanks dry and season all sides generously with salt.
2.  **Sear:** In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot, melt 2 tbsp of the tallow over medium-high heat. Sear the beef shanks on all sides until a deep brown crust forms, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove the shanks and set them aside.
3.  **Deglaze:** Pour the bone broth (or water) into the pot, scraping up any browned bits (fond) from the bottom with a wooden spoon.
4.  **Braise:** Return the shanks to the pot. The liquid should come about halfway up the meat. Bring the liquid to a gentle simmer.
5.  **Oven:** Cover the pot, transfer it to the preheated oven, and braise for 2.5 to 3 hours. The meat is done when it is exceptionally tender and pulling away from the bone.
6.  **Roast Marrow:** About 30 minutes before the shanks are done, increase the oven temperature to 400째F (200째C). (You can temporarily remove the braising pot if needed).
7.  **Prep Marrow:** Place the marrow bones, cut side up, on a small baking sheet. Season lightly with salt.
8.  **Cook Marrow:** Roast for 15-20 minutes. The marrow should be soft, bubbly, and just beginning to brown. Be careful not to overcook, or all the fat will render out.
9.  **Serve:** Carefully remove the tender beef shanks from their pot and place them on two warmed plates. Use a small spoon to scrape the warm, roasted marrow from the bones and spoon it directly over the beef shanks. Serve immediately.
