### **Instructions**

1.  **Roast the Marrow:** Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Place the marrow bone on a small baking sheet and roast for 15-20 minutes, or until the marrow is soft, bubbling, and just beginning to pull away from the bone. Scoop the marrow (you should have ~2 oz) into a small bowl and set aside.

2.  **Make the Pork Belly Crisps:** Place the finely diced pork belly into a *cold* skillet. Turn the heat to medium-low and let the fat render out slowly. Stir occasionally. After 10-12 minutes, the fat will be liquid, and the pork pieces will be small, golden, and crispy. Use a slotted spoon to remove the crisps to a plate, leaving the rendered fat in the pan. Reserve 1 tablespoon of this fat for the sauce.

3.  **Sear the Venison:** Pat the venison steaks completely dry with a paper towel and salt them generously on all sides. Heat 1 tablespoon of beef tallow in a heavy cast-iron skillet over high heat until it is just beginning to smoke.

4.  **Baste the Venison:** Carefully place the steaks in the hot pan. Sear for 2-3 minutes per side until a deep, dark crust forms. Do not move them while they are searing.

5.  **Butter-Baste:** Reduce the heat to medium. Add the 2 tablespoons of butter (or ghee) to the pan. As it melts and foams, tilt the pan toward you and use a large spoon to continuously baste the foaming butter over the top of the steaks. Continue this for 2-3 minutes, flipping the steaks once. For a perfect medium-rare, pull the steaks when an instant-read thermometer reads 130°F (54°C). Remove the venison to a wire rack to rest for 10 minutes.

6.  **Start the Reduction:** Return the same skillet to medium heat (do not wipe it out). Add the 1 tablespoon of reserved pork fat and the roasted bone marrow. Use a whisk to break up the marrow as it melts into the fat. Let it sizzle for 1 minute.

7.  **Deglaze and Reduce:** Pour the beef bone broth into the pan. It will bubble aggressively. Use your whisk to scrape all the browned bits (*fond*) from the bottom of the skillet. Let the sauce bubble and reduce by half, which should take 3-4 minutes.

8.  **Finish the Sauce (Montage):** Remove the pan from the heat. Add the 1 tablespoon of cold butter and whisk vigorously. This technique (*monter au beurre*) will emulsify the fat into the reduction, creating a glossy, slightly thickened, and stable pan sauce.

9.  **Plate and Serve:** Slice the rested venison loin against the grain. Pool the rich bone marrow reduction onto two warm plates. Arrange the venison slices fanned out on top of the sauce. Garnish the dish with a generous sprinkle of the crispy pork belly bits and a tiny pinch of the smoked finishing salt.
