### Ingredients
* 4-5 lbs bone-in beef short ribs
* 2 tbsp coarse salt (or to taste)
* 2 tbsp beef tallow, bacon grease, or ghee
* 2 cups carnivore-compliant bone broth (or water)

### Instructions
1.  **Pat Dry & Season:** Thoroughly pat the short ribs dry with a paper towel. This is key to getting a good sear. Season all sides generously with salt.
2.  **Sear the Ribs:** In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot, melt the tallow over medium-high heat. Working in batches, sear the short ribs on all sides until a deep brown crust forms (about 2-3 minutes per side).
3.  **Deglaze:** Set the seared ribs aside. Pour the bone broth (or water) into the pot, and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom.
4.  **Braise:** Return the short ribs to the pot, bone-side up if possible. The liquid should come about halfway up the ribs. Bring the liquid to a simmer.
5.  **Slow-Cook:** Cover the pot and transfer to a preheated 300°F (150°C) oven. Cook for 4-5 hours, or until the meat is exceptionally tender and falling off the bone.
    * **Slow-Cooker Option:** Alternatively, after searing, transfer the ribs and liquid to a slow cooker. Cook on **LOW** for 8 hours or on **HIGH** for 4-5 hours.
6.  **Serve:** Carefully remove the tender ribs from the pot. You can serve them immediately with the pan juices (jus) spooned over the top.

> **Optional:** For a thicker sauce, strain the juices into a small saucepan, skim the fat (if desired), and simmer on the stove until reduced to your liking.
