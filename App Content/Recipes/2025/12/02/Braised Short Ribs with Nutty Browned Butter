### Instructions

#### 1. Prepare the Ribs
Remove the short ribs from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking to bring them to room temperature. Pat them completely dry with paper towels (moisture prevents browning). Season all sides liberally with coarse sea salt.

#### 2. The Hard Sear
Preheat your oven to **300°F (150°C)**. Place a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. Add the tallow. Once the fat is shimmering and just starting to smoke, sear the ribs in batches. Do not crowd the pan. Sear for 2–3 minutes per side until a deep, dark brown crust forms. Remove ribs and set aside.

#### 3. Deglaze and Braise
Pour the beef bone broth into the hot pot. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up the "fond" (the browned bits stuck to the bottom)—this provides the deep, savory flavor usually provided by vegetables. Return the ribs to the pot, arranging them bone-side down if possible. The liquid should cover the meat halfway (add the water or extra broth if needed).

#### 4. Slow Roast
Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Transfer to the oven and cook for **3 to 3.5 hours**. The meat is done when it is fork-tender and pulling away significantly from the bone.

#### 5. Make the Whipped Browned Butter
While the ribs rest, place the stick of butter in a small light-colored saucepan over medium heat. Melt the butter and swirl strictly until it foams and the milk solids turn a golden-brown color and smell nutty (hazelnut aroma). Immediately remove from heat and pour into a heat-safe bowl to stop the cooking. Let it cool until semi-solid, then whip it with a fork or whisk until fluffy.

#### 6. Reduce and Serve
(Optional) If you want a thicker sauce, remove the ribs from the pot and boil the braising liquid on the stove over high heat for 10 minutes to reduce.

Place a short rib in a shallow bowl. Ladle the hot broth over the meat. Top with a dollop of the whipped browned butter—it will melt over the hot meat, adding a "roasted nut" flavor profile perfect for fall without using any actual nuts or spices. Garnish with flaky salt.
