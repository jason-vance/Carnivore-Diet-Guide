### Instructions

1.  **The Dry Brine (Day Before):**
    Place the rib roast on a wire rack set inside a baking sheet. Pat the meat completely dry with paper towels. Generously coat the entire roast with the **coarse sea salt**, ensuring coverage on the fat cap and bone side. Place in the refrigerator uncovered for at least 12 hours (up to 24 hours) to dry out the surface and tenderize the meat.

2.  **Prepare for Roasting:**
    Preheat your oven to **225°F (107°C)**. Remove the roast from the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for about 30–60 minutes before cooking.

3.  **The Slow Roast:**
    Place the roast (fat side up) on a rack in a roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat, away from the bone. Roast until the internal temperature reaches **120°F (49°C)** for rare or **125°F (52°C)** for medium-rare. *Note: This usually takes 35–40 minutes per pound, but rely on the thermometer, not the clock.*

4.  **Rest and Crank the Heat:**
    Remove the roast from the oven and transfer it to a cutting board. Tent loosely with foil. Let it rest for **30–45 minutes**. While resting, increase your oven temperature to **500°F (260°C)** (or as high as it goes).

5.  **Make the "Snow":**
    While the meat rests, place the softened **tallow or butter** in a bowl. Using a hand mixer or stand mixer, whip on high speed for 5–7 minutes. The fat will aerate, turning bright white and fluffy, resembling snow.

6.  **The Reverse Sear:**
    Once the meat has rested and the oven is blazing hot, place the roast back in the oven for **6–10 minutes**. Watch closely; you want a deep brown, crispy crust without overcooking the center.

7.  **Serve:**
    Slice the roast into thick portions. Top each slice with a generous dollop of the whipped "snow" and sprinkle with **flaky sea salt**.
