### Ingredients
* **1 lb (16 oz)** Beef Tenderloin (or Top Sirloin for a budget-friendly option), cut into 1.5-inch cubes
* **8 slices** Bacon (thick-cut, sugar-free/uncured), cut in half crosswise
* **1 tbsp** Beef Tallow, Bacon Grease, or Butter (melted)
* **1 tsp** Coarse Sea Salt (Redmond Real Salt or Maldon flakes work best)
* *Optional:* Toothpicks (soak in water for 10 mins if using wooden ones)

### Instructions
1.  **Preheat & Prep**
    Preheat your oven to **400°F (200°C)**. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or place a wire rack over the baking sheet for better airflow.

2.  **Wrap the Beef**
    Take a cube of beef and wrap a half-slice of bacon around the center. Secure the bacon by piercing a toothpick through the overlapping ends and into the beef. Repeat for all cubes.

3.  **Season**
    Brush the tops of the bites with the melted tallow or butter. Sprinkle strictly with the coarse sea salt.

4.  **Bake**
    Place the bites on the baking sheet, ensuring they do not touch. Bake for **15–18 minutes**.

5.  **Crisp & Serve**
    Switch the oven to **Broil (High)**. Broil the bites for **2–3 minutes** strictly to crisp up the bacon (watch closely so they don't burn). Remove, let rest for 5 minutes, and serve warm on a festive platter.
