### Ingredients

**The Crown**
* **2 full racks of lamb** (approx. 8 ribs each), un-frenched (for better fat control) or pre-frenched by butcher.
* **2 tbsp** Duck fat, Tallow, or Ghee (melted).
* **1 tbsp** Flaky sea salt (Redmond Real Salt or Maldon).

**The Marrow Forcemeat (Stuffing)**
* **10 oz (280g)** Ground lamb (high fat content).
* **4 oz (115g)** Chicken livers, cleaned and finely minced (almost a paste).
* **3 oz (85g)** Beef bone marrow, raw and diced into small cubes.
* **2** Large egg yolks.
* **1/2 cup** Pork panko (finely crushed pork rinds) – acts as the binder.
* **1 tsp** Fine sea salt.

**The "Glaze"**
* **1/2 cup** Bone broth (gelatinous).
* **2 tbsp** Salted butter (cold, cubed).

### Instructions

#### Phase 1: The Butcher's Prep (Frenching and Tying)
1.  **French the Bones:** If not done by your butcher, slice the fat cap along the rib bones about 2 inches from the tips. Scrape the bones completely clean of meat and membrane (this prevents burning). **Do not** remove the fat cap from the eye of the loin; score it in a crosshatch pattern.
2.  **Form the Hinge:** Make small slits between the vertebrae on the backside of the racks to allow them to bend.
3.  **Construct the Crown:** Stand the racks up with ribs facing outward. Bend them into a circle so the ends meet. Using butcher's twine, tie the base of the racks together firmly. Tie the center of the ribs to secure the "crown" shape.
4.  **Base Layer:** Place the crown in a cast-iron skillet or roasting pan. Brush the exterior liberally with the melted fat and press the flaky salt onto the scored fat cap.

#### Phase 2: The Forcemeat
1.  **Emulsify:** In a chilled metal bowl, mix the ground lamb, minced chicken livers, and salt. Mix vigorously by hand for 2–3 minutes until the mixture becomes tacky and sticky (this develops the protein structure called myosin, ensuring the stuffing holds together without bread).
2.  **Fold:** Gently fold in the egg yolks, pork panko, and the cubed raw bone marrow. Keep this mixture cold to prevent the marrow from melting prematurely.
3.  **Stuff:** Pack the hollow center of the lamb crown with the forcemeat. Mound it slightly in the center.

#### Phase 3: The Roast
1.  **Preheat:** Set oven to **400°F (200°C)**.
2.  **Sear:** Place the skillet on the stovetop over high heat to sear the bottom of the crown for 3 minutes.
3.  **Roast:** Transfer to the oven. Roast for **20 minutes**.
4.  **Reduce & Finish:** Lower the oven temperature to **325°F (165°C)** to cook the stuffing through without drying the lamb. Roast for another **15–20 minutes**.
5.  **Target Temp:** Use a meat thermometer. You are looking for an internal temperature of **130°F (54°C)** in the lamb loin (medium-rare) and at least **160°F (71°C)** in the center of the forcemeat.
    * *Note: If the rib tips begin to char too much, cover them with small foil hats.*

#### Phase 4: The Resting & Sauce
1.  **Rest:** Remove from the oven. Transfer the roast to a carving board. Let it rest for **15 minutes**. This is critical for the juices to redistribute.
2.  **Pan Sauce:** While resting, place the roasting pan (with the fond and drippings) over medium heat. Pour in the bone broth and scrape up the browned bits. Reduce by half. Remove from heat and whisk in the cold butter cubes to mount the sauce (create a glossy emulsion).

#### Phase 5: Service
1.  Remove the butcher's twine.
2.  Pour the sauce into the center of the stuffing (it will soak in) or drizzle over the chops.
3.  Carve by slicing between the ribs, serving each guest two chops and a scoop of the marrow-rich stuffing.
