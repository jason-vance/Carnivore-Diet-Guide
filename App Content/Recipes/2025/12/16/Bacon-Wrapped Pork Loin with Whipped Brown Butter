### Ingredients
* **3 lb** Boneless Pork Loin Roast (fat cap on)
* **1 lb** Thick-cut Bacon (sugar-free/cured with salt only)
* **1 stick (4 oz)** Unsalted Butter (or Tallow for strict dairy-free)
* **1 tbsp** Coarse Sea Salt (Redmond Real Salt or Maldon flaky salt work best)
* **1 cup** Bone Broth (pork or beef, optional for moisture in the pan)

### Instructions

#### 1. Prepare the Roast
Preheat your oven to **375°F (190°C)**. Remove the pork loin from the fridge 30 minutes prior to cooking to let it come to room temperature. Pat the meat completely dry with paper towels. Rub the coarse sea salt generously over the entire surface of the loin.

#### 2. Create the Bacon Weave
On a clean cutting board or sheet of parchment paper, lay out the bacon strips side-by-side. Place the pork loin in the center. Wrap the bacon strips up and over the loin, securing them with toothpicks if necessary to keep them in place. The goal is to encase the meat entirely in bacon fat.

#### 3. Sear (Optional but Recommended)
Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Carefully place the wrapped loin in the pan, seam-side down first to seal the bacon. Sear for **2-3 minutes** per side until the bacon begins to brown and crisp.

#### 4. Roast
Transfer the loin to a roasting pan (or keep it in the cast iron skillet). Pour the bone broth into the bottom of the pan (do not pour over the crispy bacon). Roast for **50-60 minutes**, or until the internal temperature reaches **145°F (63°C)**.

#### 5. Make the Brown Butter
While the meat rests, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Swirl constantly until the milk solids turn a golden-brown color and the butter smells nutty and toasted. Remove from heat immediately to prevent burning.

#### 6. Rest and Serve
Let the roast rest for **10-15 minutes** before carving (this locks in the juices). Slice into thick rounds and drizzle generously with the warm brown butter just before serving.

### Tips for the Perfect Carnivore Christmas
> **Texture Note:** If you prefer extra crispy bacon, you can broil the roast for the last 2-3 minutes of cooking, but watch it closely to ensure it doesn't burn.
