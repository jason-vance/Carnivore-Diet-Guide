### **Ingredients**

* **2** Halibut fillets (6–8 oz each, skin removed) – *The "snow" element.*
* **6 tbsp** Grass-fed Butter (salted or unsalted) – *The rich sauce.*
* **2 tbsp** Salmon Roe (Ikura) – *The red "ornaments."*
* **1 tsp** Flaky Sea Salt (to taste)

### **Instructions**

1. **Prepare the Fish**
Remove the halibut fillets from the refrigerator 20 minutes prior to cooking to allow them to come to room temperature. Pat them extremely dry with paper towels. Season both sides generously with sea salt.
2. **Brown the Butter**
Place a stainless steel or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the butter. Allow it to melt and foam. Swirl the pan occasionally until the foam subsides and the milk solids at the bottom turn a golden-brown hazelnut color (beurre noisette). This creates a nutty, festive aroma.
3. **Pan-Sear the Halibut**
Carefully place the halibut fillets into the brown butter. Sear for 3–4 minutes on the first side without moving them, allowing a golden crust to form.
4. **Baste the Fish**
Flip the fillets. Tilt the pan slightly so the hot butter pools at the bottom. Using a large spoon, continuously scoop the brown butter and pour it over the fish (basting) for another 2–3 minutes. The fish is done when it is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.
5. **Plating**
Transfer the halibut to warm plates. Pour the remaining brown butter from the pan over the fish.
6. **The Christmas Garnish**
Gently spoon a tablespoon of bright red Salmon Roe on top of each fillet. The heat from the fish will slightly warm the roe, releasing a savory ocean brine that cuts through the rich butter. Serve immediately.
