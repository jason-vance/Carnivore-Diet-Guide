### Ingredients

* **1 lb (450g)** Cooked chicken breast or thighs, shredded (leftover roast chicken works perfectly)

* **1 cup** Heavy whipping cream (optional: substitute with more broth or a blend of butter and water for dairy-free)
* **4 tbsp** Unsalted butter or ghee
* **3** Large egg yolks
* **Salt** to taste (Redmond Real Salt or flaky sea salt recommended)
* **Optional:** 1 tsp beef gelatin powder (for extra thickness if not using heavy cream)

### Instructions

**1. Prepare the "Garnish"**

* Slice the bacon into small squares (lardons).
* In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until it is dark red and crispy.
* Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside. **Do not drain the bacon grease.**

**2. Build the Base**

* Add the butter to the hot bacon grease in the pot.
* Pour in the chicken bone broth. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer (do not boil vigorously).
* Add the shredded chicken to the pot to warm through.

**3. Thicken the Soup**

* In a separate small bowl, whisk the egg yolks and heavy cream together until smooth.
* **Temper the mixture:** Take a ladle of the hot broth from the pot and *slowly* drizzle it into the yolk/cream bowl while whisking constantly. This prevents the eggs from scrambling.
* Pour the warmed yolk mixture back into the main soup pot, stirring gently.

**4. Final Simmer & Serve**

* Let the soup heat for another 2–3 minutes on low heat. It should thicken slightly to a chowder consistency. *Do not let it boil, or the sauce will break.*
* Taste and salt generously.
* Ladle into bowls and top with the crispy red bacon bits.
