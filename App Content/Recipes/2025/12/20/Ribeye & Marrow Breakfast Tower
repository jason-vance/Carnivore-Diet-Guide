### Ingredients

* **1 lb** Ribeye Steak (preferably 1.5 inches thick, brought to room temperature)
* **2** Beef Marrow Bone "Canoes" (lengthwise split)
* **2** Large Pasture-Raised Eggs
* **2 tbsp** Beef Tallow (or unsalted butter if dairy is tolerated)
* **To taste** Coarse Sea Salt (Maldon salt works best for a festive "snow" effect)

### Instructions

1. **Roast the "Ornaments":** Preheat your oven to **450°F (230°C)**. Place the marrow bones on a baking sheet, cut-side up. Sprinkle generously with sea salt. Roast for 15–20 minutes until the marrow is bubbling and slightly browned.
2. **Sear the Foundation:** While the marrow is roasting, pat the ribeye steak completely dry with paper towels. Season all sides heavily with salt. Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat and add 1 tablespoon of tallow. Once the skillet is smoking, sear the ribeye for 3–4 minutes per side (for medium-rare). Remove the steak and let it rest on a warm plate for at least 5 minutes.
3. **Fry the "Star":** Reduce the skillet heat to medium. Add the remaining tablespoon of tallow. Crack the eggs into the pan, keeping the yolks intact to represent the "Christmas Star." Fry until the whites are set but the yolks remain runny.
4. **Assemble the Tower:** Place the rested ribeye in the center of a warm plate. Use a small spoon to scoop the rich, roasted bone marrow directly onto the top of the steak. Carefully slide the fried eggs over the marrow.
5. **Final Flourish:** Finish the dish with a final sprinkle of coarse sea salt to mimic a light dusting of snow. Serve immediately while the marrow is hot and buttery.
