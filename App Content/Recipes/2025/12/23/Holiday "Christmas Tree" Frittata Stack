### **Instructions**

1. **Prep the "Ornaments":**
* Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
* Dice the bacon into small squares. Fry them in a skillet over medium heat until crispy. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon, keeping the bacon grease in the pan.


2. **Brown the Beef:**
* Add the ground beef to the skillet with the reserved bacon grease. Cook until fully browned.
* Season generously with salt. Drain excess liquid if desired, but keeping some fat adds flavor and satiety.


3. **Whisk the Base:**
* In a large mixing bowl, crack the 8 eggs.
* Add the heavy cream (if using) and whisk thoroughly until the mixture is light and frothy.
* Stir in the shredded cheddar cheese, the cooked ground beef, and half of the crispy bacon pieces.


4. **Bake the "Tree":**
* Generously grease a pie dish or a cast-iron skillet with butter or tallow.
* Pour the egg and meat mixture into the dish.
* Sprinkle the remaining crispy bacon on top to look like ornaments on a tree.
* Bake for **20-25 minutes**, or until the center is set and the top is golden brown.


5. **Serve:**
* Let it cool for 5 minutes before slicing into wedges.
* **Optional:** Cut the wedges into triangle shapes to mimic Christmas trees before plating.
