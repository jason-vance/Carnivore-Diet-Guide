### **Ingredients**

* **1 lb** Ground Chicken (thigh meat preferred for moisture)
* **4 slices** Bacon, cooked crispy and crumbled
* **1** Large Egg
* **1 cup** Pork Rinds (Chicharrones), unflavored

* **1 tsp** Salt (Redmond Real Salt recommended)
* **2 tbsp** Tallow, Lard, or Butter (melted)

### **Instructions**

1. **Prepare the "Snow":**
* Place the pork rinds in a blender or food processor and pulse until they turn into a fine, dust-like powder.
* *Optional:* Mix the pork rind dust with the grated parmesan cheese on a flat plate. This combination creates the whitest, most "snow-like" coating.


2. **Make the Mixture:**
* In a large bowl, combine the ground chicken, crumbled bacon, egg, salt, and half of the melted tallow (or butter).
* Mix by hand until well combined. The mixture will be sticky.


3. **Form the Snowballs:**
* Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) or prepare your air fryer.
* Roll the meat mixture into 1-inch balls (about the size of a walnut).
* Roll each ball generously in the pork rind "snow" mixture until fully coated. Press the coating in slightly to ensure it sticks.


4. **Cook:**
* **Oven Method:** Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Drizzle the remaining melted fat over them. Bake for **18-20 minutes** until golden and cooked through.
* **Air Fryer Method:** Place balls in a single layer in the basket. Air fry at 375°F (190°C) for **12-15 minutes**.


5. **Serve:**
* Serve warm on a festive platter. These have a crispy exterior and a savory, juicy interior.
