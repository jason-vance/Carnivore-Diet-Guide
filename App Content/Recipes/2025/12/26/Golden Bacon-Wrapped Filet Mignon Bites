### Ingredients

* **Steak:** 1.5 lbs (24 oz) Beef Tenderloin or Filet Mignon (cut into 1-inch cubes)
* **Bacon:** 1 lb Thin-sliced Bacon (avoid thick-cut as it is harder to wrap)
* **Fat Source:** 1/2 cup Salted Grass-fed Butter (or Beef Tallow)
* **Seasoning:** Coarse Sea Salt (Redmond Real Salt is recommended)
* **Tools:** Wooden toothpicks (soaked in water for 10 mins to prevent burning)

---

### Instructions

1. **Preparation**
* Preheat your oven to **425°F (220°C)**.
* Soak your wooden toothpicks in a small bowl of water.
* Cut the **Filet Mignon** into uniform 1-inch cubes.
* Cut the **bacon slices** in half crosswise (creating shorter strips).


2. **Assembly**
* Take a bacon half-strip and wrap it tightly around a cube of steak.
* Secure the bacon by piercing a toothpick through the overlapping bacon and the center of the steak.
* Place the bites on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a wire rack (a wire rack allows grease to drip away and bacon to crisp more evenly).


3. **Cooking**
* Place the tray in the oven and bake for **12–15 minutes**.
* *Optional:* For extra crispiness, turn the oven to **Broil (High)** for the last 1–2 minutes. Watch closely to ensure the bacon does not burn.


4. **The Dip**
* While the meat rests, melt the **salted butter** (or tallow) in a small saucepan over low heat.
* *Tip:* If you enjoy "brown butter," continue heating until the milk solids turn golden and smell nutty.


5. **Serve**
* Sprinkle the bites generously with coarse sea salt.
* Serve warm on a platter with the small bowl of melted butter for dipping.

### Chef's Notes

> **Cooking Temp:** Because the steak is cut small, it cooks fast. The goal is to get the bacon crispy before the steak becomes tough. Using room temperature steak (rather than cold from the fridge) helps it cook more evenly.

> **Strictness:** This recipe contains no plant spices. If you are more flexible, you can add garlic powder to the melted butter.
