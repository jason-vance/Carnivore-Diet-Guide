The Midnight Salty Sparkler

**Summary:** 
A zero-calorie, zero-carb, electrolyte-rich drink. The high carbonation cleanses the palate between fatty snack bites, and the salt rim adds a "margarita" feel without the sugar.

* **Difficulty:** Very Easy
* **Prep Time:** 2 minutes
* **Servings:** 1 Drink

### Ingredients

* **1 cup Sparkling Mineral Water** (Topo Chico or Perrier work best for high carbonation)
* **1/2 tsp Coarse Sea Salt** (Redmond Real Salt or pink salt)
* **Ice Cubes** (optional, crushed looks more festive)
* **Water** (for wetting the rim)

### Instructions

1. **Rim the Glass:** Pour the coarse salt onto a small plate. Wet the rim of a champagne flute or coupe glass with a little water (or a swipe of tallow if you want the salt to stick heavily). Dip the rim into the salt to coat it evenly.
2. **Ice (Optional):** If using a coupe glass or tumbler, add crushed ice. If using a champagne flute, ensure the sparkling water is ice-cold beforehand and skip the ice cubes to keep the carbonation high.
3. **Pour:** Gently pour the sparkling mineral water into the glass.
4. **Serve:** Serve immediately while the bubbles are active. Sip slowly, enjoying the contrast of the cold bubbles and the salt against rich fatty snacks.
