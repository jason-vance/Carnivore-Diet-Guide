### Ingredients

* **4 tbsp** Salted Butter
* **1/2 cup** Heavy Whipping Cream
* **2 strips** Bacon
* **1 large** Egg Yolk
* **1/4 cup** Beef Bone Broth (optional, for thinner consistency)
* **Salt** (Redmond Real Salt or flaky sea salt preferred)

### Instructions

1. **Crisp the Bacon**
In a small saucepan or skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon strips until very crispy. Remove the bacon and set it aside to cool. Keep the rendered bacon fat in the pan. Once cooled, crumble the bacon into fine "confetti" pieces.
2. **Brown the Butter**
Add the butter to the pan with the bacon fat. Melt it over medium heat. Continue cooking, swirling the pan occasionally, until the butter foams and then quiets down. Watch closely for the milk solids to turn a golden-brown hazelnut color (beurre noisette) and emit a nutty aroma.
3. **Simmer the Cream**
Immediately lower the heat to low. Slowly pour in the heavy whipping cream while whisking constantly to emulsify the fat and liquid. Let this simmer gently for 2–3 minutes until slightly reduced.
4. **Temper the Yolk**
Place the egg yolk in a separate small bowl. Take one tablespoon of the hot cream mixture and whisk it rapidly into the yolk (this prevents the egg from scrambling). Repeat with one more tablespoon.
5. **Final Emulsion**
Pour the tempered yolk mixture back into the main saucepan, whisking continuously. Cook for another 30–60 seconds until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Do not let it boil.
6. **Finish & Serve**
Stir in the crumbled bacon bits. Taste and add salt if needed (the bacon and salted butter may provide enough). Pour immediately over a ribeye, prime rib, or seafood.
