### **Ingredients**

* **4 lbs** Beef Short Ribs (bone-in, English style cut)
* **3 tbsp** Beef Tallow (or Ghee/Butter if dairy is tolerated)

* **1 tbsp** Coarse Sea Salt (or Redmond Real Salt), plus more to taste
* **1 cup** Water (if needed to cover meat halfway)

### **Instructions**

1. **Preheat & Prep:** Preheat your oven to **325°F (163°C)**. Pat the short ribs completely dry with paper towels (this ensures a good crust). Generously coat all sides of the ribs with the coarse sea salt.
2. **Sear the Meat:** Heat a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. Add the beef tallow. Once the fat is shimmering hot, sear the ribs in batches. Sear for about **2–3 minutes per side** until a deep brown crust forms. Remove seared ribs and set aside.
3. **Deglaze:** Pour the beef bone broth into the hot pot. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up the browned bits (fond) from the bottom of the pot—this adds immense flavor.
4. **Assemble:** Return the short ribs to the pot, nestling them into the liquid bone side down if possible. The liquid should come about halfway up the sides of the meat. If necessary, add the cup of water to reach that level.
5. **Braise:** Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Transfer to the oven and cook for **3 to 3.5 hours**.
6. **Reduce (Optional):** Check the meat; it should be fork-tender and falling off the bone. Remove the ribs to a platter. Place the pot back on the stove over high heat and boil the liquid for **5–10 minutes** to reduce it into a thicker, salty jus.
7. **Serve:** Pour the hot reduction over the ribs and serve immediately.
