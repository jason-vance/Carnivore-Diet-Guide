### Ingredients

* **1 lb (450g)** Pork belly, skin removed, sliced into ¼ inch thick strips (similar to thick-cut bacon)
* **4** Large eggs
* **1 tbsp** Beef tallow, pork lard, or unsalted butter (for the eggs)
* **1 tsp** Coarse sea salt (Redmond Real Salt or similar)

### Instructions

1. **Prep the Pan:**
Place the pork belly strips into a large, cold cast-iron skillet or stainless steel pan. (Starting with a cold pan helps render the fat more effectively without burning the meat).
2. **Render and Crisp:**
Turn the heat to medium-low. Let the pork belly cook slowly, turning occasionally. As the fat renders out and becomes liquid, the meat will begin to fry in its own juices. Cook for 15–18 minutes, or until the pork is golden brown and crispy to your liking.
3. **Rest the Meat:**
Remove the crispy pork belly strips from the pan and set them aside on a plate. Sprinkle generously with half of the salt immediately while they are hot.
4. **Cook the Eggs:**
Keep about 2 tablespoons of the rendered hot pork fat in the pan (you can discard the excess or save it for later). Crack the eggs directly into the hot fat.
* *Option A (Fried):* Fry until the whites are set but yolks are runny.
* *Option B (Scrambled):* Lower heat, add the extra tablespoon of tallow/butter for richness, and gently scramble until fluffy.


5. **Serve:**
Plate the eggs next to the crispy pork belly. Top the eggs with the remaining salt. Serve immediately while hot.
