### Ingredients

* **1 lb (450g)** Chicken thighs (boneless, skinless), sliced into long "fettuccine" style strips
* **4 oz (115g)** Guanciale or Pancetta (cured pork jowl or belly), diced
* **3** Large egg yolks (room temperature)
* **1** Whole large egg (room temperature)
* **1 cup (90g)** Pecorino Romano cheese, freshly grated (finely)
* **1 tbsp** Tallow, lard, or butter (for frying)
* **Salt** to taste (use sparingly, as the cheese and cured pork are salty)
* *Optional:* 1/4 cup reserved water (or bone broth) to help emulsify the sauce

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Sauce Base**
In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the **egg yolks**, **whole egg**, and most of the **Pecorino Romano** (save a little for garnish). Whisk until it forms a thick, consistent paste. Set aside.
2. **Crisp the Pork**
Place a large skillet over medium heat. Add the **diced guanciale/pancetta**. Sauté until the fat renders out and the meat becomes crispy and golden (about 5–7 minutes).
*Tip: Remove the crispy pork from the pan and set aside, but leave the rendered liquid fat in the pan.*
3. **Cook the "Noodles"**
If the pan is dry, add the **tallow or butter**. Increase heat to medium-high. Add the **chicken strips** in a single layer (cook in batches if necessary to avoid steaming). Sear until golden brown and fully cooked through (about 4–5 minutes per side).
4. **Combine and Cool Slightly**
Turn the heat down to the lowest setting (or remove from heat entirely if you have an electric stove). Add the crispy pork back into the pan with the chicken and toss to combine.
*Crucial Step:* Let the pan cool for 60 seconds. If the pan is too hot, the eggs will scramble rather than turn into a sauce.
5. **Emulsify (The Carbonara Technique)**
Pour the **egg and cheese mixture** over the chicken and pork. immediately begin tossing and stirring vigorously. The residual heat from the chicken and fat will cook the eggs and melt the cheese, creating a creamy, glossy emulsion.
* *Troubleshooting:* If the sauce is too thick or clumpy, add a splash of warm water (or broth) and continue stirring until smooth.


6. **Serve**
Plate immediately. Top with the remaining grated Pecorino Romano and a pinch of flake salt if desired.
