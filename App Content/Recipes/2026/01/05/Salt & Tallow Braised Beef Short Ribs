### **Ingredients**

* **3–4 lbs** Bone-in beef short ribs (approx. 4–6 ribs)
* **2 tbsp** Beef tallow (or unsalted butter)
* **1 tbsp** Coarse sea salt (Redmond Real Salt or similar)
* **1 cup** Beef bone broth (check labels for additives) or water

### **Instructions**

1. **Prep the Meat:** Pat the short ribs completely dry with paper towels to ensure a good sear. Generously coat all sides of the ribs with the coarse sea salt.
2. **Sear:** Set your pressure cooker (e.g., Instant Pot) to **Sauté** (High). Add the beef tallow and let it melt. Once hot, place the ribs in the pot meat-side down. Sear for 3–4 minutes per side until a deep brown crust forms. Work in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding.
3. **Deglaze:** Remove the ribs and set aside. Pour the bone broth (or water) into the pot. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up the browned bits (fond) from the bottom—this adds flavor and prevents burn errors.
4. **Pressure Cook:** Place the ribs back into the pot, bone-side down if possible, submerging them slightly in the liquid. Secure the lid and set the valve to **Sealing**. Cook on **High Pressure** for **45 minutes**.
5. **Release:** Once the timer beeps, allow for a **Natural Release** for 15 minutes (do not touch the valve). After 15 minutes, manually release any remaining pressure.
6. **Serve:** Remove the ribs carefully (they will be very tender). Pour the rendered fat and broth from the pot over the meat for extra fat macros and flavor.
