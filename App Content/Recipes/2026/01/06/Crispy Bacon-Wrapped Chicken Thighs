### Instructions

1. **Prep the Chicken:** Pat the chicken thighs completely dry with paper towels. This ensures a better sear. Generously salt all sides of the chicken.
2. **Wrap:** Wrap 2 slices of bacon around each chicken thigh. Try to overlap the ends of the bacon on the "bottom" side of the thigh so they stay secure while cooking.
3. **Heat the Pan:** Place a cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. Add the butter or tallow and let it melt until it shimmers.
4. **Sear:** Place the chicken thighs in the pan, seam-side down first (to seal the bacon). Cook for about 5–7 minutes until the bacon is crispy and golden brown.
5. **Flip and Cook:** Flip the chicken thighs. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover the pan with a lid to ensure the chicken cooks through without burning the bacon. Cook for another 12–15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).
6. **Rest and Serve:** Remove from the pan and let the chicken rest for 5 minutes to retain juices. Pour the remaining pan drippings over the chicken before serving.
