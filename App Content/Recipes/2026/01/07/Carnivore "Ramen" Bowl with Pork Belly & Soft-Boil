### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Pork Belly**
* Generously salt the pork belly on all sides. Roll it into a log and tie tightly with butcher's twine to maintain a round shape.
* *Optional Step:* Let it sit in the fridge uncovered for 4–12 hours to dry brine and intensify flavor.
* Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). Place the pork in a small baking dish or Dutch oven. Add 1 cup of water (and optional bonito flakes) to the bottom of the dish.
* Cover tightly with foil or a lid and braise for 1.5 to 2 hours until tender.


2. **Crisp the Pork**
* Remove pork from the oven. Increase oven heat to 450°F (230°C) or use the broiler.
* Place the pork on a wire rack over a baking sheet. Roast/broil for 5–10 minutes until the fat cap is golden and crispy.
* Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing into thin rounds.


3. **Make Soft-Boiled Eggs (Ajitsuke Tamago Style)**
* Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. Carefully lower the eggs in.
* Boil for exactly 6 minutes and 30 seconds for a jammy yolk.
* Immediately transfer eggs to an ice water bath to stop cooking. Peel once cool.


4. **Assemble the Bowl**
* Heat the pork bone broth in a saucepan until simmering. Stir in the fish sauce and adjust salt levels. The fish sauce provides the salty, fermented kick usually provided by soy sauce.
* Slice the eggs in half lengthwise.
* Arrange the pork belly slices in two bowls. Add the halved eggs.
* Pour the hot broth over the meat and eggs. Serve immediately.
