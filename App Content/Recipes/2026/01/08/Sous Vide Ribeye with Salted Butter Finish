### **Ingredients**

* **1 Thick-Cut Ribeye Steak:** Approx. 1.5 to 2 inches thick (boneless or bone-in).

* **2 tbsp Grass-Fed Butter:** Cold, for finishing.
* **1 tbsp Beef Tallow or Ghee:** For searing (has a higher smoke point than butter).

### **Instructions**

**1. Prepare the Water Bath**
Set your Sous Vide precision cooker to your desired doneness temperature.

* **Rare:** 120°F (49°C)
* **Medium-Rare:** 129°F (54°C) **(Recommended)**
* **Medium:** 135°F (57°C)

**2. Season and Seal**
Pat the steak dry with paper towels. Generously season all sides of the ribeye with coarse salt. Place the steak into a vacuum-seal bag or a heavy-duty freezer bag (using the water displacement method) and seal it tight.

**3. Cook**
Submerge the bag in the preheated water bath. Cook for **1.5 to 2 hours**. (You can go up to 3 hours without degrading the texture, but 2 is optimal).

**4. Dry the Steak**
Remove the bag from the water. Take the steak out and place it on a paper towel-lined plate. Pat the steak **extremely dry** on all sides.

*> **Note:** Moisture is the enemy of a good sear. The drier the steak, the better the crust.*

**5. Sear**
Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add the beef tallow or ghee. Once the fat is smoking hot, carefully place the steak in the pan. Sear for roughly **45–60 seconds per side** until a deep brown crust forms. Do not cook longer, or you risk overcooking the interior.

**6. Rest and Serve**
Remove the steak from the pan and place it on a warm plate. Immediately top with the cold grass-fed butter so it melts over the crust. Let the meat rest for 5–10 minutes before slicing to retain the juices.
