### Ingredients

* **1 lb (16 oz)** Beef liver (fresh, sliced thin)
* **6 slices** Thick-cut bacon (sugar-free/cured only with salt is ideal)
* **2 tbsp** Beef tallow or salted butter (optional, for extra fat)
* **1 tsp** Redmond Real Salt (or coarse sea salt), to taste

### Instructions

1. **Prep the Liver**
* Rinse the liver slices under cold water and pat them completely dry with paper towels. Removing moisture ensures a good sear rather than steaming.
* Slice the liver into manageable strips or bite-sized pieces if not already sliced.


2. **Render the Bacon**
* Place a cast-iron skillet over medium heat.
* Add the bacon strips and cook until crispy and the fat has fully rendered.
* Remove the cooked bacon and set aside on a plate, leaving the hot bacon grease in the pan.


3. **Sear the Liver**
* Increase the heat to medium-high. The fat should be shimmering.
* Place the liver slices into the hot pan. **Do not overcrowd**; cook in batches if necessary.
* Sear for **60–90 seconds** per side. The goal is a browned crust on the outside while keeping the inside slightly pink.
* *Note: Overcooking liver causes the texture to become tough and chalky.*


4. **Finish and Serve**
* Remove the liver from the pan immediately.
* Crumble the crispy bacon over the top of the liver.
* Pour any remaining hot fat from the pan over the meat (or add a pat of butter/tallow to melt on top).
* Generously season with salt and serve warm.



> **Pro Tip:** If you find the metallic taste of liver too strong, you can soak the raw liver slices in milk (or salt water if strictly dairy-free) for 1–2 hours before cooking. Rinse and pat dry before searing.
