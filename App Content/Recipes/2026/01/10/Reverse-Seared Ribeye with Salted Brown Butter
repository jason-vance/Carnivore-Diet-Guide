### Ingredients

* **1 Ribeye Steak (12-16 oz):** Look for thick-cut (approx. 1.5 inches) with heavy marbling.
* **2 tbsp Salted Butter:** Grass-fed is preferred for better nutrient profile.
* **1 tbsp Beef Tallow or Bacon Grease:** For searing (has a higher smoke point than butter).
* **Redmond Real Salt (or coarse sea salt):** To taste.

### Instructions

1. **Preparation**
* Remove the steak from the refrigerator 30 minutes prior to cooking to allow it to come to room temperature.
* Preheat your oven to **250°F (120°C)**.
* Pat the steak completely dry with paper towels (essential for a good crust later).
* Generously season all sides of the steak with salt.


2. **The Slow Roast**
* Place the steak on a wire rack set over a baking sheet.
* Roast in the oven for **25–35 minutes**.
* Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature. Pull the steak when it reaches:
* *Rare:* 115°F (46°C)
* *Medium-Rare:* 125°F (52°C)




3. **The Sear**
* While the steak rests for a moment, heat a cast-iron skillet over **high heat**.
* Add the beef tallow (or bacon grease). Once it begins to smoke slightly, carefully place the steak in the skillet.
* Sear for **45–60 seconds per side** to develop a deep brown crust. Do not overcook.


4. **The Brown Butter Finish**
* Reduce the heat to low.
* Toss in the 2 tablespoons of salted butter.
* Allow the butter to foam and turn a nutty brown color (about 30 seconds).
* Tilt the pan and spoon the hot, browned butter over the steak repeatedly for 30 seconds.


5. **Rest and Serve**
* Transfer the steak to a plate or cutting board.
* Pour the remaining browned butter from the pan over the steak.
* Let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing to retain the juices.
