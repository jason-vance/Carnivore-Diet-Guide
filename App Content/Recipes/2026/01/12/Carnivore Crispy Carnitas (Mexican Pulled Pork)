### Ingredients

**The Meat & Fat**

* **4 lbs (1.8 kg) Pork Shoulder (Boston Butt)** – Boneless or bone-in. This cut is essential for its high fat content and collagen.
* **1/4 cup Bacon Grease or Lard (Manteca)** – Strictly animal fat. Do not use vegetable oils.
* **1 tbsp coarse Redmond Real Salt** (or other high-quality sea salt) – Use more to taste.
* **1 cup Bone Broth** (Beef or Pork) – Optional, for moisture in the slow cooker.

**The "Mexican Style" Flavor Profile**
*(Note: Strict carnivores use only salt. If you include spices in your version of the diet, these are the traditional seasonings to achieve the specific "Carnitas" flavor.)*

* 1 tsp Dried Oregano (Mexican variety if available)
* 1 tsp Ground Cumin
* 1/2 tsp Chili Powder or Smoked Paprika

### Instructions

1. **Prep the Meat:**
* Pat the pork shoulder dry with paper towels.
* Cut the meat into large 3-inch cubes. Keep the fat cap on; do not trim the fat (this is fuel).
* Generously coat all sides of the pork cubes with the salt (and optional spices, if using).


2. **Slow Cook:**
* Place the pork cubes into a slow cooker.
* Add the **bone broth** (if using). If you prefer a true confit style and have enough saved bacon grease/lard, you can skip the broth and add extra solid fat here instead.
* Cook on **LOW for 8 hours** or **HIGH for 5-6 hours**. The meat is done when it falls apart effortlessly with a fork.


3. **Shred:**
* Remove the pork from the slow cooker with a slotted spoon and place it in a large bowl.
* Roughly shred the meat using two forks. *Tip: Don't shred it too finely; leave some chunks for better texture contrast.*
* Pour about 1/2 cup of the cooking juices (the liquid left in the pot) back over the shredded meat to keep it moist.


4. **Crisp (The "Carnitas" Step):**
* *This is the most important step for authentic texture.*
* Heat the **bacon grease or lard** in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat.
* Add the pork in batches (do not overcrowd the pan). Press the meat down with a spatula to sear it.
* Fry for 3–5 minutes until the bottom is brown and crispy (chicharrón-style edges).
* Flip and fry for another 2 minutes.


5. **Serve:**
* Serve immediately while hot and crispy.
* **Serving Idea:** Use large pork rinds (chicharrones) as "chips" for scooping, or make a "carnivore taco" using an egg-white wrap or a cheese crisp shell.
