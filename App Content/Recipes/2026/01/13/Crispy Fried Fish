### Ingredients

* **Fish:** 1 lb (450g) white fish fillets (Cod, Halibut, or Haddock), patted dry
* **Breading:** 1.5 cups Pork rinds (chicharrones), plain/unflavored
* **Binder:** 2 large Eggs, beaten
* **Fat:** 3 tbsp Beef Tallow, Lard, or Bacon Grease (for frying)
* **Seasoning:** 1 tsp Sea salt (Redmond Real Salt or Maldon)

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Breading:** Place the pork rinds in a blender or food processor and pulse until they resemble fine breadcrumbs. Alternatively, place them in a zip-lock bag and crush them with a rolling pin. Pour the crumbs into a shallow dish and mix in half of the salt.
2. **Set Up Station:** In a separate shallow bowl, whisk the eggs until smooth.
3. **Coat the Fish:** Dip each fish fillet first into the beaten eggs, allowing the excess to drip off, then press firmly into the pork rind crumbs to coat all sides evenly.
4. **Heat the Fat:** In a cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed pan, melt the tallow (or lard) over medium-high heat. The fat is ready when it shimmers but is not smoking.
5. **Fry:** Carefully place the fillets in the hot fat. Fry for 3–4 minutes on one side until the crust is deep golden brown and crispy.
6. **Flip and Finish:** Flip carefully and cook for another 3–4 minutes on the other side until the fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.
7. **Serve:** Remove from the pan and place on a wire rack to drain slightly. Sprinkle with the remaining salt while hot and serve immediately.
