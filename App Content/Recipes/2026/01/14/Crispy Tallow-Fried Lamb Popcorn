### Ingredients

* **1 lb (450g)** Ground lamb (preferably 80/20 or fatty grind)
* **2 tbsp** Beef tallow, bacon grease, or ghee (for frying)
* **1 tsp** Pink Himalayan salt (or Redmond Real Salt)
* **Optional:** 1 tsp Garlic powder (if you include spices in your version of carnivore)

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Meat:**
In a medium bowl, combine the ground lamb and salt (and optional spices). Mix gently with your hands until the salt is evenly distributed. Do not overwork the meat, or it may become tough.
2. **Form the Bites:**
Roll the mixture into small, bite-sized balls (about the size of a ping pong ball or slightly smaller). Flatten them slightly to ensure even cooking and maximum surface area for crisping.
3. **Heat the Fat:**
Place a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef tallow (or your chosen fat) and let it melt. The pan is ready when the fat shimmers and is very hot.
4. **Sear and Fry:**
Place the lamb bites into the hot skillet, ensuring they are not touching. You may need to do this in two batches.
5. **Cook to Crisp:**
Fry for about 3–4 minutes on one side until a dark, crispy crust forms. Flip and cook for another 2–3 minutes on the other side until cooked through.
6. **Rest and Serve:**
Remove from the pan and let them rest on a wire rack or plate for 2 minutes to lock in the juices. Serve warm.
