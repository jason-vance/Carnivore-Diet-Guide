### Ingredients

* 4 Large egg yolks
* 1 cup (240ml) Heavy whipping cream
* 3 tbsp Unsalted butter
* ¼ tsp Sea salt (Redmond Real Salt recommended)
* *Optional:* 1 tsp Raw local honey (Note: strictly exclude for zero-carb protocols, but acceptable in some "animal-based" variations)

### Instructions

1. **Preheat & Prep:** Preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C). Place two ramekins into a deep baking dish.
2. **Brown the Butter:** In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Swirl the pan occasionally until the milk solids turn a golden toasty brown and smell nutty (about 3–5 minutes). Pour into a small heat-proof bowl to stop the cooking and let it cool slightly.
3. **Warm the Cream:** In the same saucepan (no need to wash), add the heavy cream and salt. Heat gently over medium-low heat until it begins to steam (do not let it boil). Remove from heat.
4. **Whisk the Yolks:** In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth.
5. **Temper the Mixture:** Slowly drizzle the browned butter into the yolks while whisking constantly. Next, slowly pour the warm cream into the yolk/butter mixture, whisking continuously to prevent the eggs from scrambling.
6. **Strain (Optional):** For an ultra-smooth texture, pour the custard base through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any cooked egg bits or large butter solids.
7. **Bake:** Divide the mixture evenly between the ramekins. Pour hot water into the baking dish until it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins (water bath). Bake for 35–45 minutes. The centers should still be slightly jiggly like Jell-O.
8. **Chill:** Remove ramekins from the water bath and let them cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours to set completely before serving.
