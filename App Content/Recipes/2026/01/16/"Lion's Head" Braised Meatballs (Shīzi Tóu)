### Ingredients

**The Meatballs**

* 1 lb (450g) ground pork (ideally 70% lean / 30% fat)
* 1 large egg
* ½ cup pork rinds, crushed into a fine powder (acts as a binder instead of cornstarch)
* 1 tsp high-quality salt (Redmond Real Salt or sea salt)
* 1 tsp fish sauce (ingredients must be anchovy and salt only—e.g., Red Boat) *[Optional for umami]*

**The Braise**

* 2 cups pork or chicken bone broth (unsalted, homemade is best)
* 2 tbsp tallow, lard, or bacon grease (for frying)
* *(Optional Aromatics for infusion - remove before eating):* 1 star anise, 2 slices fresh ginger

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Binder:**
Place the pork rinds in a blender or food processor and pulse until they resemble fine breadcrumbs or flour.
2. **Mix the Meat:**
In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, egg, crushed pork rinds, salt, and fish sauce. Mix vigorously with your hand or chopsticks in a circular motion for 2–3 minutes.
* *Tip:* This step is crucial; the meat should become sticky and form a paste. This texture (called "jiao") ensures the meatballs stay bouncy and tender without plant starches.


3. **Shape the Lion's Heads:**
Divide the mixture into 4 large, equal-sized meatballs. Wet your hands slightly with water or oil to prevent sticking, and pack them firmly so they don't break apart during cooking.
4. **Sear:**
Heat the tallow or lard in a wok or deep skillet over medium-high heat. Carefully place the meatballs in the pan. Sear for 2–3 minutes on each side until they develop a golden-brown crust. You don't need to cook them through yet; just seal the exterior.
5. **Braise:**
Pour the bone broth into the pan around the meatballs. If using aromatics (star anise/ginger), add them to the liquid now. Bring the broth to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to low.
6. **Simmer:**
Cover the pan and let simmer gently for 25–30 minutes. The collagen in the pork and the broth will meld, creating a rich, silky mouthfeel.
7. **Serve:**
Discard the ginger/star anise if used. Serve the meatballs in a bowl with a generous ladle of the cooking broth.

### A Note on Dipping

Traditional Chinese meatballs are often eaten with vinegar or soy sauce. For a strict carnivore alternative, these are best enjoyed with a sprinkle of flaky salt or a small side of salted egg yolk for extra richness.
