### Ingredients

* **10-12 Large Sea Scallops:** Fresh (dry scallops preferred to ensure a good sear).
* **4 slices Prosciutto (or Jambon de Bayonne):** Thinly sliced.
* **4 tbsp Unsalted Butter:** Quality grass-fed butter is best for flavor.
* **1/4 cup Crème Fraîche (or Heavy Cream):** For the sauce.
* **1 tbsp Tallow, Ghee, or Bacon Fat:** For searing at high heat.
* **Flaky Sea Salt:** To taste.

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Prosciutto**
* Place a skillet over medium heat. Add the slices of prosciutto in a single layer (you may need to do this in batches).
* Cook until rendered and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side.
* Remove from the pan and set on a plate to cool. Once cooled, crumble them into small, bacon-bit sized pieces.


2. **Dry the Scallops**
* While the pan is still hot, ensure your scallops are extremely dry. Pat them thoroughly with paper towels. If they are wet, they will steam rather than sear.
* Season the scallops generously with salt on both sides.


3. **Sear the Scallops**
* Wipe the skillet clean if needed and add your high-heat fat (tallow or ghee). Increase heat to medium-high until the fat is shimmering.
* Place the scallops in the pan, leaving space between them. **Do not touch them** for exactly 2 minutes. You want a deep golden crust.
* Flip the scallops. They should release easily if the crust is formed.


4. **Make the Beurre Noisette (Brown Butter)**
* Immediately after flipping, add the **4 tbsp of butter** to the pan.
* As the butter melts and begins to foam, tilt the pan slightly and use a spoon to baste the scallops repeatedly with the hot butter.
* Watch the butter closely; it will turn a hazelnut-brown color and smell nutty. This should take about 1.5 to 2 minutes.
* Remove the scallops immediately to a warm plate to prevent overcooking.


5. **Finish the Sauce**
* Reduce the heat to low. With the brown butter still in the pan, stir in the **crème fraîche** (or heavy cream).
* Whisk gently, scraping up any browned bits (fond) from the bottom of the pan. Let it simmer for 1-2 minutes until slightly thickened and cohesive.


6. **Assemble**
* Pour the warm brown butter cream sauce onto two plates.
* Place the scallops on top of the sauce.
* Garnish generously with the crumbled crispy prosciutto and a pinch of flaky sea salt.
