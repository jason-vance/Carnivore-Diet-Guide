### Ingredients

* **1 lb (450g) Pork Belly:** Skin-on is traditional for crunch, but skinless works too. Slice into 1-inch thick strips.
* **3 tbsp Premium Fish Sauce:** Must be sugar-free (e.g., Red Boat brand, which is just anchovies and salt).
* **1 tbsp Pork Lard or Tallow (melted):** For the marinade.
* **1 cup Tallow or Lard:** For frying (enough to submerge the pork halfway).
* **Optional (for texture):** 1/2 cup crushed pork rinds (chicharrones) if you want a "breaded" crust, though this recipe works beautifully without them.

### Instructions

1. **Prep the Pork**
Wash the pork belly strips and pat them very dry with paper towels. Using a fork, poke holes all over the surface of the meat and skin to help it absorb the marinade.
2. **Marinate**
In a bowl, mix the pork belly with the **fish sauce** and the **1 tbsp of melted fat**. Massage the liquid into the meat thoroughly. Let it sit at room temperature for **30 minutes**.
* *Tip:* If you are strictly animal-based but miss "breading," you can roll the marinated pork in crushed pork rinds at this stage.


3. **Heat the Oil**
Add the **1 cup of tallow/lard** to a wok or deep skillet (cast iron is excellent). Heat over medium-high heat until the fat shimmers (approx. 350°F / 175°C).
4. **Fry**
Carefully place the pork belly strips into the hot fat. **Caution:** It may splatter due to the moisture in the fish sauce. You can use a splatter screen or partially cover with a lid (leaving a crack for steam to escape).
Fry for about **7–10 minutes per side**, flipping occasionally, until the pork is golden brown and the edges are crispy.
5. **Rest and Serve**
Remove the pork and set on a wire rack to drain excess fat. Let it rest for 5 minutes (this keeps the juices inside). Slice into bite-sized pieces and serve warm.
