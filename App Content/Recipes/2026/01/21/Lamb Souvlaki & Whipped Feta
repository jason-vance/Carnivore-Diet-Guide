### Ingredients

**The Meat**

* 1 lb (450g) Lamb shoulder or leg, cut into 1.5-inch cubes
* 2 tbsp Beef tallow or Ghee (melted)
* 1.5 tsp Sea salt (Redmond Real Salt recommended)
* 1 tsp Dried oregano (technically plant-based; omit for strict "Lion Diet" adherence)

**The Whipped Feta**

* 4 oz (115g) Block feta cheese (in brine)
* 1/4 cup Heavy whipping cream
* 1 tbsp Butter (softened)

### Instructions

1. **Marinate the Lamb:** In a mixing bowl, combine the cubed lamb, melted tallow, salt, and oregano. Toss until every piece is thoroughly coated. For best results, let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes (or refrigerate for up to 4 hours) to allow the salt to penetrate the meat.
2. **Prepare the Dip:** While the meat rests, crumble the feta cheese into a small blender or food processor. Add the heavy cream and softened butter. Blitz until the mixture is smooth and creamy. If it is too thick, add a teaspoon of water or more cream to reach your desired consistency. Set aside.
3. **Skewer:** Thread the lamb pieces onto skewers. If using wooden skewers, ensure they have been soaked in water beforehand.
4. **Cook:**
* **Grill Method:** Preheat grill to high heat. Grill skewers for 4–5 minutes per side, rotating until the exterior is charred and the fat has rendered, but the inside remains juicy (medium-rare to medium).
* **Pan Method:** Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the meat (off the skewer if necessary) for 3–4 minutes, turning frequently to brown all sides.


5. **Serve:** Plate the hot lamb immediately with a generous dollop of the whipped feta on the side for dipping.
