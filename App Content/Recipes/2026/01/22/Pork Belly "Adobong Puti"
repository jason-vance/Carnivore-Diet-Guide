### Instructions

1. **Combine & Marinate (Optional):**
Place the pork belly cubes in a deep skillet or Dutch oven. Add the fish sauce and toss well to coat. Let it sit for 10 minutes to absorb the salty, umami flavor.
2. **Braise the Meat:**
Pour in the water (or bone broth). If using the optional vinegar, add it now (do not stir after adding vinegar until it boils, a traditional Filipino technique to prevent raw acid taste). Bring the liquid to a boil over medium-high heat.
3. **Simmer:**
Lower the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 30–40 minutes, or until the pork is fork-tender and the fat has begun to render.
4. **Render & Fry:**
Remove the lid. Increase the heat to medium. Allow the water to completely evaporate until only the rendered pork fat and the added lard remain. The pork will begin to fry in its own oil.
5. **Crisp the Edges:**
Add the extra tablespoon of lard/tallow if the pork hasn't rendered enough fat. Fry the pork cubes, turning frequently, until they are golden brown and the skin is slightly crispy (about 5–8 minutes).
6. **Serve:**
Remove from heat. Serve hot, pouring the savory rendered fat and fish sauce drippings over the meat.
